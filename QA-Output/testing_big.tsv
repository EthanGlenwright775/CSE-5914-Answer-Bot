"Use the following article to answer the question: Article:  (CNN)Lawyer Robert Abela will become Malta's new Prime Minister after securing a surprising victory in his party's leadership contest, which was triggered by a political scandal over the assassination of an investigative journalist that brought down the country's previous leader and several of his allies.Abela was seen as an outsider in the race to succeed Joseph Muscat, who announced his resignation in December, but defeated his rival Chris Fearne to take control of the country's governing Labour Party. He is expected to be sworn in on Monday.Muscat announced his plans to step down in December, as the investigation into the death of Daphne Caruana Galizia -- killed by a car bomb in October 2017 -- began to engulf his premiership.Caruana Galizia had been investigating alleged corruption within the government, and her family and protesters have accused Muscat of trying to shield members of his inner circle from the ongoing investigation into her death.Muscat has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. His chief of staff and tourism minister also left their posts shortly before the prime minister announced his resignation late last year.Read MoreAbela, a 42-year-old lawyer, stressed continuity during his campaign and steered clear of addressing the probe into Galizia's death, according to local media. His rival Fearne was backed by most of the country's Cabinet. But Abela strode to what the Times of Malta described as ""one of the biggest upsets in contemporary political history."" It was expected that 17,500 Labour voters would decide the party's election, according to Agence France-Presse.Muscat said on Twitter he was ""proud"" to be handing power to the lawyer, who could hold his post for over two years before Malta's next election must take place.But the initial months of his premiership are likely to be dominated by the same scandal that defeated his predecessor.Investigation stretches into new yearGalizia's case will remain prominent in the EU nation during Abela's time in power, with three men awaiting trial on charges connected to the incident. All three suspects pleaded not guilty during pre-trial proceedings. The journalist was killed while driving near her home. Her family says she was ""assassinated"" because of her work uncovering alleged corruption in the Maltese government. Her work -- including research into Maltese citizens implicated in the Panama Papers -- had made powerful enemies. The Panama Papers are the name for the leak of millions of files from the database of a Panama law firm called Mossack Fonseca in 2016.Why murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia is back in the newsMuscat was a frequent target of Galizia's investigations into corruption, especially due to his wife's alleged involvement in the Panama companies. Galizia's family had said they believe the then-Prime Minister wanted her dead. The couple both deny the allegations.The journalist had suffered intimidation over the years. Her dog's throat was cut, and in 2006 her house was set on fire as the family slept, tires piled against the back door to prevent escape.Shortly before her death, in what was to be the final entry on her blog Running Commentary, she wrote: ""There are crooks everywhere you look now. The situation is desperate.""""Robert Abela certainly has his work cut out for him,"" Rebecca Vincent, the UK bureau director of the nonprofit Reporters Without Borders, told CNN. ""Joseph Muscat leaves behind a legacy of a tarnished administration and deeply flawed institutions,"" she added. ""During his tenure, not only was the country's most prominent journalist assassinated in broad daylight -- so far, with impunity -- but Malta's broader press freedom climate experienced one of the world's sharpest declines.""Malta has slid to 77th on the group's annual rankings of global press freedom, one of the worst scores in Europe.CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Susanna Capelouto and Simon Cullen contributed reporting.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Paris (CNN)He was once the subject of mockery in French political circles. Now Emmanuel Macron has had the last laugh.The independent centrist, who had never held elected office, has become the Fifth Republic's youngest ever president after defeating far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.The 39-year-old former investment banker, who entered the race without the backing of an established political party, had been branded by his opponents as inexperienced.But part of Macron's allure is his atypical rise -- a civil servant who became a millionaire and eventually a government minister.Marriage a focusRead MoreHis private life has attracted attention, too.As a 17-year-old, he told his high school teacher that he would one day marry her. He fulfilled that promise in 2007 when Brigitte Trogneux, 24 years his senior, became his wife.French journalist Anne Fulda reveals more details about their relationship in her recent book, ""Emmanuel Macron: A Perfect Young Man."" According to Reuters, the book tells how the teenage Macron defied his father's orders to end the romance with Trogneux, who was married with three children at the time. Macron's wife Brigitte -- once his high school teacher -- has been highly visible during his campaign. Since 2015, the previously very private couple have been spending more time with the media, appearing in several French glossy magazines. The marriage took center stage earlier this year when Macron was accused of having an affair with a man. He dismissed the allegations and criticized the rumormongers, saying: ""For those who want to spread the rumor that I am deceitful... not only is it unpleasant for Brigitte, but I promise that from morning until night, she shares my whole life with me. She's wondering how I could physically do it.""From minister to candidateBorn in the northern French city of Amiens where he went to school and first met Trogneux, Macron studied at Paris's prestigious Lycée Henry IV before entering the Ecole National d'Administration, long a training ground for France's political elite.Appointed to President Francois Hollande's staff in 2012 after a successful career in the banking sector, Macron moved into the role of economy minister two years later, replacing the more left-wing Arnaud Montebourg.The beginner's guide to the French electionsBut his time in office was not without controversy. His determination to push through business-friendly, liberal reforms made him unpopular on the government's own benches.With a backbench rebellion and government defeat looming, the so-called ""Macron Law,"" which aimed to shake up the economy through labor reform, had to be forced through the National Assembly with the help of a controversial parliamentary measure.It led to several days of protest, but also to Macron's realization that it was not just the economy that needed to change, but the system itself.Announcing his resignation in August, he explained that he had ""touched with his own finger, the limits of the system,"" before catapulting himself into the presidential race by launching his own party, En Marche!What he's pledgedMacron's election manifesto promised to reform France's welfare and pensions systems.He has been vocal about the fight against terror and law and order, announcing proposals to increase defense spending, hire 10,000 more police officers and create a task force that would work around the clock to fight ISIS.Macron's policies had been aimed at wooing conservative voters, but he has also unveiled proposals to please the left too, such as his call for better pay for teachers working in poor, socially diverse areas.He is staunchly pro-European and has promised to put France back at the heart of the EU and defend the bloc's single market.He has also struck a diplomatic tone seeking constructive dialogue with US President Donald Trump, while expressing interest in working with Russia, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia towards lasting political solutions in Syria and elsewhere.The frightening similarities between the US and French electionsAnd he's managed to pull in support from across the political spectrum in France. In March, former Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced he would be voting for Macron rather than his own party's candidate, and after the results of the first round were announced, defeated Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon and Republicans Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe pledged their support and asked their voters to do the same.Crucially, Macron managed to attract a number of first-time voters of all ages.En Marche!, which was only created in September, now has more than 200,000 members and his meetings have attracted vast crowds.With his strong support base boosted by Republicans and Socialists, Macron was propelled into the Élysée Palace.The campaign may be over, but the real work is only just beginning. As Macron himself said: ""A new page of our history"" has been turned. Question: Who was once the subject of mockery in French political circles?"

His determination to push through business-friendly, liberal reforms made him unpopular on the government's own benches.With a backbench rebellion and government defeat looming, the so-called ""Macron Law,"" which aimed to shake up the economy through labor reform, had to be forced through the National Assembly with the help of a controversial parliamentary measure.It led to several days of protest, but also to Macron's realization that it was not just the economy that needed to change, but the system itself.Announcing his resignation in August, he explained that he had ""touched with his own finger, the limits of the system,"" before catapulting himself into the presidential race by launching his own party, En Marche!What he's pledgedMacron's election manifesto promised to reform France's welfare and pensions systems.He has been vocal about the fight against terror and law and order, announcing proposals to increase defense spending, hire 10,000 more police officers and create a task force that would work around the clock to fight ISIS.Macron's policies had been aimed at wooing conservative voters, but he has also unveiled proposals to please the left too, such as his call for better pay for teachers working in poor, socially diverse areas.He is staunchly pro-European and has promised to put France back at the heart of the EU and defend the bloc's single market.He has also struck a diplomatic tone seeking constructive dialogue with US President Donald Trump, while expressing interest in working with Russia, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia towards lasting political solutions in Syria and elsewhere.The frightening similarities between the US and French electionsAnd he's managed to pull in support from across the political spectrum in France. In March, former Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced he would be voting for Macron rather than his own party's candidate, and after the results of the first round were announced, defeated Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon and Republicans Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe pledged their support and asked their voters to do the same.Crucially, Macron managed to attract a number of first-time voters of all ages.En Marche!, which was only created in September, now has more than 200,000 members and his meetings have attracted vast crowds.With his strong support base boosted by Republicans and Socialists, Macron was propelled into the Élysée Palace.The campaign may be over, but the real work is only just beginning. As Macron himself said: ""A new page of our history"" has been turned. Question: How did he win the election?"	Macron's strong support base was boosted by Republicans and Socialists.The campaign may be over, but the real work is only just beginning.

David McAtee's nephew had also previously told CNN affiliate WAVE that the chef was shot while reaching out to grab his niece. Steve Romines, an attorney representing the McAtee family, confirmed to CNN the individual identified by initials in the indictment is Machelle.""We agree with the Grand Jury's decision today that criminal activity by LMPD in the unwarranted shooting at innocent bystanders outside of YaYa's BBQ is what directly (led) to the death of David McAtee,"" the attorney told CNN in a statement Thursday.If convicted, Crews could face up to ten years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release, according to the indictment.Dozens came out to remember David McAtee on June 1, 2021, one year since the Louisville barbecue owner was shot and killed.The aftermath of the shootingThe fatal shooting happened amid widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice that erupted across the city -- and the country -- following the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville. No charges will be brought against law enforcement over the fatal shooting of a Louisville restaurant owner last yearCrews is the second former Louisville officer to face federal charges of using excessive force during those protests. Former officer Cory Evans pleaded guilty last year to hitting a kneeling person in the head who was surrendering during an arrest in May 2020. He was sentenced last month to two years in prison followed by two years of supervised release. Louisville's police chief was fired hours after McAtee's killing after officials discovered that two officers at the scene -- Crews and Austin Allen -- had either not worn or activated their body cameras, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer had said. Both Crews and Allen were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into the shooting. National Guard members involved in the incident were not identified, CNN previously reported.

CNN has also reached out to the police department for an update on Allen's status.The lawsuit filed by McAtee's family in 2020 named Crews and Allen individually because they were seen in surveillance video shooting pepper balls into the crowd where McAtee was last seen alive, Romines previously told CNN. The suit also accused 10 unnamed Louisville officers and 10 unnamed state National Guard members with using excessive force, among other charges.

He'd always wanted to be at that location and was hoping to buy the lot and build a more permanent restaurant, he told the blog.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article:  (CNN)Officials in Georgia will be required to release accused criminals from jail while they're awaiting indictment because of a backlog of cases that grew during the pandemic, according to the Fulton County District Attorney.Suspects who've been charged with crimes in Georgia are entitled to bond if they're not indicted within 90 days, and though that law was suspended during the pandemic, it was reinstated over the summer.  Murders rose sharply in 2020 but data is lacking across much of the countryThat means hundreds of defendants accused of crimes, many of them violent, are now eligible or soon will be eligible for release.  ""We walked into an office with an excess of 11,000 unindicted cases,"" said Fani Willis, the District Attorney of Fulton County, which includes Atlanta.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: London (CNN)Standing at the feet of the early 20th century feminist Millicent Fawcett -- the only woman to be honored with a statue in the UK's Parliament Square -- I held the microphone up as high as I could to capture the impassioned words of her present-day successors. ""Did women get the vote by waiting for it to be granted to them?"" activist Steph Pike bellowed into a loudspeaker.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article:  (CNN)The US hit a seven-day average of 265,427 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, blowing past the country's previous record of about 252,000 daily cases, reported nearly a year ago on January 11.The new peak, according to Johns Hopkins University data, comes amid a rapid acceleration of infections in the United States -- and across the world -- since last month.And experts predict the Omicron variant -- the most contagious strain of coronavirus yet -- is going to make the start of 2022 very difficult. ""January is going to be a really, really hard month. And people should just brace themselves for a month where lots of people are going to get infected,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.Between Christmas and New Year's, doctors expect the US Omicron surge to growAnd the US could ""see half a million cases a day -- easy -- sometime over the next week to 10 days,"" CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner said Sunday.Read MoreMost people who are vaccinated and boosted won't get severe illness, but that won't be true for the unvaccinated, Jha said.""A lot of people who have not gotten a vaccine are going to end up getting pretty sick, and it's going to be pretty disruptive,"" Jha said. ""My hope is as we get into February and certainly by the time we get into March, infection numbers will come way down, and it'll also start getting (into) spring, and the weather will start getting better. And that will also help.""Despite calls from experts for Americans to get their vaccines and boosters, the rate of booster doses getting administered has fallen in recent weeks -- while only 32.7% of the country's fully vaccinated population is boosted. In addition to getting vaccinated and boosted, people can protect themselves by taking precautions in public, Jha said.JUST WATCHEDOmicron derails holiday plans, strains hospitalsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHOmicron derails holiday plans, strains hospitals 02:23""I would urge people to wear a higher quality mask any time they're in a place with lots of people and they're going to be indoors for any extended period of time,"" Jha said.A surgical mask might be fine for a quick grocery store trip in an empty store, but for other events, a well-fitting N95 or KF94 mask provides better protection, he said.Looking ahead to New Year's Eve on Friday, small gatherings of fully vaccinated people will be safe, Dr. Anthony Fauci said. But people should avoid large parties where they don't know the vaccination status of all guests, he said.""When you are talking about a New Year's Eve party where you have 30, 40, 50 people celebrating, you do not know the status of the vaccination, I would recommend strongly: Stay away from that this year,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.""There will be other years to do that. But not this year.""Pediatric hospitalizations nearing previous recordHoliday gatherings, like those over Christmas and New Year's, have some health care workers worried about the impact on children in the coming weeks -- especially those who are too young to be vaccinated. New Omicron variant fills up children's hospitals""We've just had all of these kids mixing together with everybody else during Christmas,"" said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, the director of pediatric infection control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Ohio.""We have one more holiday to get through with New Year's, and then we'll be sending everybody back to school. Everybody is kind of waiting on the edge, wondering what we'll end up seeing.""Nationwide, pediatric Covid-19 hospitalizations are nearing the record high set in September.On average, roughly 305 children were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended December 26, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services.That's more than a 48% jump from the previous week's average and just 10.7% lower than the peak average of 342 children who were admitted to hospitals with the virus that was recorded at the end of August and early September. In New York City, where cases are surging and the average percent positivity rate is continuing to trend upward, pediatric hospitalizations increased five-fold over a three-week period. In Chicago, hospitalizations at one children's hospital have quadrupled. At Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, close to half the Covid-19 tests are coming back positive.At Texas Children's Pediatrics & Urgent Care in Houston, the chief medical officer is concerned about the current surge, he said.""What's concerning on the (pediatric) side is that, unlike the adults -- where they're reporting for the number of adults getting infected relatively low numbers getting hospitalized -- what we're really seeing, we think, is an increasing number of kids being hospitalized,"" Dr. Stanley Spinner said. People wait in line for Covid-19 tests Monday at a mobile testing site in New York's Times Square.Children are an easy target for the virus, said Dr. Juan Salazar, physician in chief at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford.""It's affecting larger communities and it's certainly affecting children in a way that we hadn't seen before,"" he said. ""And that's new compared to last year.""CDC updates isolation guidelinesDays after updating its guidance on isolation time for health care workers who test positive for Covid-19, the CDC updated its guidance for the general population.The agency shortened the recommended time for isolation for people with Covid-19 to five days, if asymptomatic, followed by five days of wearing a mask when around others. The prior guidance advised 10 days of isolation.JUST WATCHEDCDC shortens recommended Covid-19 isolation period from 10 days to 5 ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCDC shortens recommended Covid-19 isolation period from 10 days to 5  03:27""The change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after,"" the CDC said in a statement about the updated guidelines.The new recommendations will allow asymptomatic people ""to come back to work earlier, and safely, at very low risk,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.""That will help us in the New Year begin to get our gears back into operation and to function better.""The CDC also updated its recommended quarantine period for those exposed to someone with Covid-19.For those who are unvaccinated, have not had a second mRNA dose in more than six months or have not had a booster shot, the CDC recommends quarantining for five days followed by strict mask use for an additional five days. People who have gotten their booster shot do not need to quarantine if they are exposed to Covid-19, but they should wear a mask for 10 days after exposure, the CDC said.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: TV OT is a weekly look at what CNN's entertainment team is watching since too much television has us all working overtime. (CNN)And just like that, another chapter of ""Sex and the City"" is over. Simply put, this HBO Max revival — which was minus one Samantha and added a lot of new faces — has divided a fandom. (HBO Max, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)""And Just Like That..."" was never going to please everyone. That's just how TV goes. But even those who still prefer to forget the existence of the much-panned films couldn't have predicted the pure volume of hot takes and chilly tweets that this show would inspire week after week. The loudest critics of the revival will say they've continued the 10-episode journey in the form of hate watching, tuning in weekly knowing that they'll be bothered by any number of characters or plot points. But I'd argue most have continued because of something stronger — Sunk Cost Streaming. ""Sex and the City"" loyalists have invested too much time, energy, tears and laughs to just walk away. We're in a committed relationship with Carrie and Co. And because we care, we can't help but wonder until the very end: Can they get it right?Read MoreEveryone's answer will be different, but in the end, here's my take on the best -- and not-so-best -- parts of ""And Just Like That..."": The bestAri Nicole Parker.Wonder(ful) women -- Part of me looks at characters like single realtor Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), fabulous Park Avenue mom Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) and professor Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman) with such sadness. In the original series, any of these women could have carried the meaty storylines of a main cast member season after season. It's a shame this New York City-set world waited so long to literally and figuratively invite women of color to take a seat at the high top, and having them debut in a season where many other storylines had to be served, I feel they were short-changed. Lisa was introduced in a scene in which she ate Carrie's leftover french fries, and I haven't been able to erase the visual from my mind since. This glamorous gazelle deserves a main course. In fact, I wouldn't mind continuing to see more of any of their journeys.Charlotte York Goldenblatt -- Of all the characters, Charlotte was by far the one who seemed like she'd actually lived through the last decade. Yes, she'd experienced it from her million-dollar home, but that's who she is. Every scene and every line of hers felt ripped from the original show -- none perhaps more so than the scene at Lisa's house when she took a long, impressive dive into the reasons her friend's art collection was an incredible investment, defending Lisa against her mother-in-law's criticisms. It was classic Charlotte -- smart, sweet, supportive when it matters, and yes, Carrie, a little smug. (Supportive Charlotte also shined through in the storyline involving her child's desire to explore their gender identity and be referred to by they/them pronouns.) More than anyone else on the show, Charlotte 2022 came across like that special person in your life who evolves but never changes, in the best way.How it handled grief -- The first episodes of ""And Just Like That..."" were by no means easy to watch. You can debate all day long whether they should have killed Big. (Honestly, considering the off-screen drama, the producers are probably happy they did.) But you can't question that Carrie's grief was portrayed raw and real. It served as a reminder that in the grand scheme of life, although Post-It note breakups sting, they are really just paper cuts compared to real pain. Che Diaz, the concept -- Miranda's love affair with Carrie's podcasting boss will go down in ""SATC"" history as one of the most polarizing storylines in the franchise. On paper, this could have been a real smash of a storyline: Miranda, in a marriage more dead than Big (sorry, Steve), explores a relationship with a bold, non-binary breath of fresh air. Wonderful! The problem, for me, was how they chose to bring this character to life. Which brings me to...The worstSarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Che Diaz, the character -- I'm not in a place to speak on behalf of any community of which I am not a part, so I will refrain from going too deep on some points here. But everything about Rock (Alexa Swinton), Charlotte and Harry's child, was handled with such grace, which is what made Che Diaz, who is nonbinary, an incredibly jarring presence. Che (Sara Ramirez), a self-described narcassist and so-called comedian, is in many ways the kind of toxic figure I've tried to steer my friends away from for a long time. The character triggered my friend radar -- beep, beep, this person sucks, beep, beep, retreat, save friend. When portraying any member of an underrepresented community, perfection is not the expectation, but there's a responsibility to make it count. When you don't see yourself on screen a lot -- where my fellow Latinx at? -- you want to feel like the portrayals mean something. On a platform as big as the ""Sex and the City"" franchise, it's hard to see Che as anything other than a gigantic missed opportunity at best and a giant middle finger at worst. Miranda Hobbes -- Miranda's greatest offense in this revival wasn't living her truth; it was not being truthful. I remember wondering mid-way through what I'd missed in the last 10 years that turned Miranda, the woman who respected a culture enough to learn Arabic before a trip to Abu Dhabi, into a person who doesn't respect her very decent husband enough to tell him the truth about where she's at emotionally. If Charlotte was the character equivalent of finding your favorite pair of designer heels still fit like a glove, Miranda is that pair of boots you find in the back of your closet that over time have become unrecognizable as something that you once liked. When Miranda called Carrie from a cab and declared, ""I'm in a rom-com!,"" I paused the episode to cringe. ""No, Miranda,"" I thought, ""you're in a tragedy."" She would have been better served as a vehicle for a story about true recovery from alcoholism than ... whatever this was.Brady Hobbes -- I know the subplot about Brady and his girlfriend's boundary-less sex life died off after the first few episodes, but I wish it never existed. It set a terrible tone for the series. Someone should have put this storyline on a Peloton. How they handled Samantha's absence -- We all know Kim Cattrall had no desire to take part in ""And Just Like That...,"" which is a decision its producers had no choice but to respect and work with. They certainly tried their best, but the idea that the women's relationship fell apart over a petty dispute was the hardest pill to swallow. That, and who tells their grieving widow friend that you will talk to them ""soon"" when she asks to speak with you? Not the Samantha I know. Thankfully, we can imagine Carrie and Samantha mending fences in Paris, per the finale. The problem with that? If ""And Just Like That..."" has any plans for yet another chapter, there's no doing it without Samantha. (I won't hold my breath for her return.)The very bestKristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon -- Before watching every new episode of ""And Just Like That...,"" I felt the same knots in my stomach that I get before getting on a roller coaster or walking down wet stairs in high heels. That doesn't happen if you aren't deeply invested in something. Like it or not, ""Sex and the City"" lovers, you haven't been hate watching -- you've been care watching. And we care because Parker, Davis and Nixon have embodied their characters so fully, so second-naturedly, that each woman and their life feels real. We're angry at Miranda, we wanted Carrie to pick up the phone faster to call an ambulance, we cringed when Charlotte made a shameful mistake at a dinner party. They are incredible talents who've told decades of story through three distinct pairs of eyes, and for that, we can't be anything but grateful. As we've learned, it's crucial to enjoy a ride while it is happening, because it can be over just like that.  Question: what is tv ot?"

You can debate all day long whether they should have killed Big. (Honestly, considering the off-screen drama, the producers are probably happy they did.) But you can't question that Carrie's grief was portrayed raw and real. It served as a reminder that in the grand scheme of life, although Post-It note breakups sting, they are really just paper cuts compared to real pain. Che Diaz, the concept -- Miranda's love affair with Carrie's podcasting boss will go down in ""SATC"" history as one of the most polarizing storylines in the franchise. On paper, this could have been a real smash of a storyline: Miranda, in a marriage more dead than Big (sorry, Steve), explores a relationship with a bold, non-binary breath of fresh air. Wonderful! The problem, for me, was how they chose to bring this character to life. Which brings me to...The worstSarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Che Diaz, the character -- I'm not in a place to speak on behalf of any community of which I am not a part, so I will refrain from going too deep on some points here. But everything about Rock (Alexa Swinton), Charlotte and Harry's child, was handled with such grace, which is what made Che Diaz, who is nonbinary, an incredibly jarring presence. Che (Sara Ramirez), a self-described narcassist and so-called comedian, is in many ways the kind of toxic figure I've tried to steer my friends away from for a long time. The character triggered my friend radar -- beep, beep, this person sucks, beep, beep, retreat, save friend. When portraying any member of an underrepresented community, perfection is not the expectation, but there's a responsibility to make it count. When you don't see yourself on screen a lot -- where my fellow Latinx at? -- you want to feel like the portrayals mean something. On a platform as big as the ""Sex and the City"" franchise, it's hard to see Che as anything other than a gigantic missed opportunity at best and a giant middle finger at worst. Miranda Hobbes -- Miranda's greatest offense in this revival wasn't living her truth; it was not being truthful. I remember wondering mid-way through what I'd missed in the last 10 years that turned Miranda, the woman who respected a culture enough to learn Arabic before a trip to Abu Dhabi, into a person who doesn't respect her very decent husband enough to tell him the truth about where she's at emotionally. If Charlotte was the character equivalent of finding your favorite pair of designer heels still fit like a glove, Miranda is that pair of boots you find in the back of your closet that over time have become unrecognizable as something that you once liked. When Miranda called Carrie from a cab and declared, ""I'm in a rom-com!,"" I paused the episode to cringe. ""No, Miranda,"" I thought, ""you're in a tragedy."" She would have been better served as a vehicle for a story about true recovery from alcoholism than ... whatever this was.Brady Hobbes -- I know the subplot about Brady and his girlfriend's boundary-less sex life died off after the first few episodes, but I wish it never existed. It set a terrible tone for the series. Someone should have put this storyline on a Peloton. How they handled Samantha's absence -- We all know Kim Cattrall had no desire to take part in ""And Just Like That...,"" which is a decision its producers had no choice but to respect and work with. They certainly tried their best, but the idea that the women's relationship fell apart over a petty dispute was the hardest pill to swallow. That, and who tells their grieving widow friend that you will talk to them ""soon"" when she asks to speak with you? Not the Samantha I know. Thankfully, we can imagine Carrie and Samantha mending fences in Paris, per the finale. The problem with that? If ""And Just Like That..."" has any plans for yet another chapter, there's no doing it without Samantha. (I won't hold my breath for her return.)The very bestKristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon -- Before watching every new episode of ""And Just Like That...,"" I felt the same knots in my stomach that I get before getting on a roller coaster or walking down wet stairs in high heels. That doesn't happen if you aren't deeply invested in something. Like it or not, ""Sex and the City"" lovers, you haven't been hate watching -- you've been care watching. And we care because Parker, Davis and Nixon have embodied their characters so fully, so second-naturedly, that each woman and their life feels real. We're angry at Miranda, we wanted Carrie to pick up the phone faster to call an ambulance, we cringed when Charlotte made a shameful mistake at a dinner party. They are incredible talents who've told decades of story through three distinct pairs of eyes, and for that, we can't be anything but grateful. As we've learned, it's crucial to enjoy a ride while it is happening, because it can be over just like that.  Question: What's the best part of ""And Just Like That?"	The loudest critics of the revival will say they've continued the 10-episode journey in the form of hate watching, tuning in weekly knowing that they'll be bothered by any number of characters or plot points.

But even those who still prefer to forget the existence of the much-panned films couldn't have predicted the pure volume of hot takes and chilly tweets that this show would inspire week after week. The loudest critics of the revival will say they've continued the 10-episode journey in the form of hate watching, tuning in weekly knowing that they'll be bothered by any number of characters or plot points. But I'd argue most have continued because of something stronger — Sunk Cost Streaming. ""Sex and the City"" loyalists have invested too much time, energy, tears and laughs to just walk away. We're in a committed relationship with Carrie and Co. And because we care, we can't help but wonder until the very end: Can they get it right?Read MoreEveryone's answer will be different, but in the end, here's my take on the best -- and not-so-best -- parts of ""And Just Like That..."": The bestAri Nicole Parker.Wonder(ful) women -- Part of me looks at characters like single realtor Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), fabulous Park Avenue mom Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) and professor Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman) with such sadness. In the original series, any of these women could have carried the meaty storylines of a main cast member season after season. It's a shame this New York City-set world waited so long to literally and figuratively invite women of color to take a seat at the high top, and having them debut in a season where many other storylines had to be served, I feel they were short-changed. Lisa was introduced in a scene in which she ate Carrie's leftover french fries, and I haven't been able to erase the visual from my mind since. This glamorous gazelle deserves a main course. In fact, I wouldn't mind continuing to see more of any of their journeys.Charlotte York Goldenblatt -- Of all the characters, Charlotte was by far the one who seemed like she'd actually lived through the last decade. Yes, she'd experienced it from her million-dollar home, but that's who she is. Every scene and every line of hers felt ripped from the original show -- none perhaps more so than the scene at Lisa's house when she took a long, impressive dive into the reasons her friend's art collection was an incredible investment, defending Lisa against her mother-in-law's criticisms. It was classic Charlotte -- smart, sweet, supportive when it matters, and yes, Carrie, a little smug.

On paper, this could have been a real smash of a storyline: Miranda, in a marriage more dead than Big (sorry, Steve), explores a relationship with a bold, non-binary breath of fresh air. Wonderful! The problem, for me, was how they chose to bring this character to life. Which brings me to...The worstSarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Che Diaz, the character -- I'm not in a place to speak on behalf of any community of which I am not a part, so I will refrain from going too deep on some points here. But everything about Rock (Alexa Swinton), Charlotte and Harry's child, was handled with such grace, which is what made Che Diaz, who is nonbinary, an incredibly jarring presence. Che (Sara Ramirez), a self-described narcassist and so-called comedian, is in many ways the kind of toxic figure I've tried to steer my friends away from for a long time. The character triggered my friend radar -- beep, beep, this person sucks, beep, beep, retreat, save friend. When portraying any member of an underrepresented community, perfection is not the expectation, but there's a responsibility to make it count. When you don't see yourself on screen a lot -- where my fellow Latinx at? -- you want to feel like the portrayals mean something. On a platform as big as the ""Sex and the City"" franchise, it's hard to see Che as anything other than a gigantic missed opportunity at best and a giant middle finger at worst. Miranda Hobbes -- Miranda's greatest offense in this revival wasn't living her truth; it was not being truthful. I remember wondering mid-way through what I'd missed in the last 10 years that turned Miranda, the woman who respected a culture enough to learn Arabic before a trip to Abu Dhabi, into a person who doesn't respect her very decent husband enough to tell him the truth about where she's at emotionally. If Charlotte was the character equivalent of finding your favorite pair of designer heels still fit like a glove, Miranda is that pair of boots you find in the back of your closet that over time have become unrecognizable as something that you once liked. When Miranda called Carrie from a cab and declared, ""I'm in a rom-com!,"" I paused the episode to cringe. ""No, Miranda,"" I thought, ""you're in a tragedy."" She would have been better served as a vehicle for a story about true recovery from alcoholism than ... whatever this was.Brady Hobbes -- I know the subplot about Brady and his girlfriend's boundary-less sex life died off after the first few episodes, but I wish it never existed. It set a terrible tone for the series. Someone should have put this storyline on a Peloton. How they handled Samantha's absence -- We all know Kim Cattrall had no desire to take part in ""And Just Like That...,"" which is a decision its producers had no choice but to respect and work with. They certainly tried their best, but the idea that the women's relationship fell apart over a petty dispute was the hardest pill to swallow. That, and who tells their grieving widow friend that you will talk to them ""soon"" when she asks to speak with you? Not the Samantha I know. Thankfully, we can imagine Carrie and Samantha mending fences in Paris, per the finale. The problem with that? If ""And Just Like That..."" has any plans for yet another chapter, there's no doing it without Samantha. (I won't hold my breath for her return.)The very bestKristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon -- Before watching every new episode of ""And Just Like That...,"" I felt the same knots in my stomach that I get before getting on a roller coaster or walking down wet stairs in high heels. That doesn't happen if you aren't deeply invested in something. Like it or not, ""Sex and the City"" lovers, you haven't been hate watching -- you've been care watching. And we care because Parker, Davis and Nixon have embodied their characters so fully, so second-naturedly, that each woman and their life feels real. We're angry at Miranda, we wanted Carrie to pick up the phone faster to call an ambulance, we cringed when Charlotte made a shameful mistake at a dinner party. They are incredible talents who've told decades of story through three distinct pairs of eyes, and for that, we can't be anything but grateful. As we've learned, it's crucial to enjoy a ride while it is happening, because it can be over just like that.  Question: What were the first episodes of ""And Just Like That...""?"

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: TV OT is a weekly look at what CNN's entertainment team is watching since too much television has us all working overtime. (CNN)And just like that, another chapter of ""Sex and the City"" is over. Simply put, this HBO Max revival — which was minus one Samantha and added a lot of new faces — has divided a fandom. (HBO Max, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)""And Just Like That..."" was never going to please everyone. That's just how TV goes. But even those who still prefer to forget the existence of the much-panned films couldn't have predicted the pure volume of hot takes and chilly tweets that this show would inspire week after week. The loudest critics of the revival will say they've continued the 10-episode journey in the form of hate watching, tuning in weekly knowing that they'll be bothered by any number of characters or plot points. But I'd argue most have continued because of something stronger — Sunk Cost Streaming. ""Sex and the City"" loyalists have invested too much time, energy, tears and laughs to just walk away. We're in a committed relationship with Carrie and Co. And because we care, we can't help but wonder until the very end: Can they get it right?Read MoreEveryone's answer will be different, but in the end, here's my take on the best -- and not-so-best -- parts of ""And Just Like That..."": The bestAri Nicole Parker.Wonder(ful) women -- Part of me looks at characters like single realtor Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), fabulous Park Avenue mom Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) and professor Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman) with such sadness. In the original series, any of these women could have carried the meaty storylines of a main cast member season after season. It's a shame this New York City-set world waited so long to literally and figuratively invite women of color to take a seat at the high top, and having them debut in a season where many other storylines had to be served, I feel they were short-changed. Lisa was introduced in a scene in which she ate Carrie's leftover french fries, and I haven't been able to erase the visual from my mind since. This glamorous gazelle deserves a main course. In fact, I wouldn't mind continuing to see more of any of their journeys.Charlotte York Goldenblatt -- Of all the characters, Charlotte was by far the one who seemed like she'd actually lived through the last decade. Yes, she'd experienced it from her million-dollar home, but that's who she is. Every scene and every line of hers felt ripped from the original show -- none perhaps more so than the scene at Lisa's house when she took a long, impressive dive into the reasons her friend's art collection was an incredible investment, defending Lisa against her mother-in-law's criticisms. It was classic Charlotte -- smart, sweet, supportive when it matters, and yes, Carrie, a little smug. (Supportive Charlotte also shined through in the storyline involving her child's desire to explore their gender identity and be referred to by they/them pronouns.) More than anyone else on the show, Charlotte 2022 came across like that special person in your life who evolves but never changes, in the best way.How it handled grief -- The first episodes of ""And Just Like That..."" were by no means easy to watch. You can debate all day long whether they should have killed Big. (Honestly, considering the off-screen drama, the producers are probably happy they did.)

When you don't see yourself on screen a lot -- where my fellow Latinx at? -- you want to feel like the portrayals mean something.

Miranda Hobbes -- Miranda's greatest offense in this revival wasn't living her truth; it was not being truthful. I remember wondering mid-way through what I'd missed in the last 10 years that turned Miranda, the woman who respected a culture enough to learn Arabic before a trip to Abu Dhabi, into a person who doesn't respect her very decent husband enough to tell him the truth about where she's at emotionally. If Charlotte was the character equivalent of finding your favorite pair of designer heels still fit like a glove, Miranda is that pair of boots you find in the back of your closet that over time have become unrecognizable as something that you once liked. When Miranda called Carrie from a cab and declared, ""I'm in a rom-com!,"" I paused the episode to cringe. ""No, Miranda,"" I thought, ""you're in a tragedy."" She would have been better served as a vehicle for a story about true recovery from alcoholism than ... whatever this was.Brady Hobbes -- I know the subplot about Brady and his girlfriend's boundary-less sex life died off after the first few episodes, but I wish it never existed. It set a terrible tone for the series. Someone should have put this storyline on a Peloton. How they handled Samantha's absence -- We all know Kim Cattrall had no desire to take part in ""And Just Like That...,"" which is a decision its producers had no choice but to respect and work with. They certainly tried their best, but the idea that the women's relationship fell apart over a petty dispute was the hardest pill to swallow. That, and who tells their grieving widow friend that you will talk to them ""soon"" when she asks to speak with you? Not the Samantha I know. Thankfully, we can imagine Carrie and Samantha mending fences in Paris, per the finale. The problem with that? If ""And Just Like That..."" has any plans for yet another chapter, there's no doing it without Samantha.

That doesn't happen if you aren't deeply invested in something. Like it or not, ""Sex and the City"" lovers, you haven't been hate watching -- you've been care watching. And we care because Parker, Davis and Nixon have embodied their characters so fully, so second-naturedly, that each woman and their life feels real. We're angry at Miranda, we wanted Carrie to pick up the phone faster to call an ambulance, we cringed when Charlotte made a shameful mistake at a dinner party.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: TV OT is a weekly look at what CNN's entertainment team is watching since too much television has us all working overtime. (CNN)And just like that, another chapter of ""Sex and the City"" is over. Simply put, this HBO Max revival — which was minus one Samantha and added a lot of new faces — has divided a fandom. (HBO Max, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)""And Just Like That..."" was never going to please everyone. That's just how TV goes. But even those who still prefer to forget the existence of the much-panned films couldn't have predicted the pure volume of hot takes and chilly tweets that this show would inspire week after week. The loudest critics of the revival will say they've continued the 10-episode journey in the form of hate watching, tuning in weekly knowing that they'll be bothered by any number of characters or plot points. But I'd argue most have continued because of something stronger — Sunk Cost Streaming. ""Sex and the City"" loyalists have invested too much time, energy, tears and laughs to just walk away. We're in a committed relationship with Carrie and Co. And because we care, we can't help but wonder until the very end: Can they get it right?Read MoreEveryone's answer will be different, but in the end, here's my take on the best -- and not-so-best -- parts of ""And Just Like That..."": The bestAri Nicole Parker.Wonder(ful) women -- Part of me looks at characters like single realtor Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), fabulous Park Avenue mom Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) and professor Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman) with such sadness. In the original series, any of these women could have carried the meaty storylines of a main cast member season after season. It's a shame this New York City-set world waited so long to literally and figuratively invite women of color to take a seat at the high top, and having them debut in a season where many other storylines had to be served, I feel they were short-changed. Lisa was introduced in a scene in which she ate Carrie's leftover french fries, and I haven't been able to erase the visual from my mind since. This glamorous gazelle deserves a main course. In fact, I wouldn't mind continuing to see more of any of their journeys.Charlotte York Goldenblatt -- Of all the characters, Charlotte was by far the one who seemed like she'd actually lived through the last decade. Yes, she'd experienced it from her million-dollar home, but that's who she is. Every scene and every line of hers felt ripped from the original show -- none perhaps more so than the scene at Lisa's house when she took a long, impressive dive into the reasons her friend's art collection was an incredible investment, defending Lisa against her mother-in-law's criticisms. It was classic Charlotte -- smart, sweet, supportive when it matters, and yes, Carrie, a little smug. (Supportive Charlotte also shined through in the storyline involving her child's desire to explore their gender identity and be referred to by they/them pronouns.) More than anyone else on the show, Charlotte 2022 came across like that special person in your life who evolves but never changes, in the best way.How it handled grief -- The first episodes of ""And Just Like That..."" were by no means easy to watch. You can debate all day long whether they should have killed Big. (Honestly, considering the off-screen drama, the producers are probably happy they did.) But you can't question that Carrie's grief was portrayed raw and real. It served as a reminder that in the grand scheme of life, although Post-It note breakups sting, they are really just paper cuts compared to real pain. Che Diaz, the concept -- Miranda's love affair with Carrie's podcasting boss will go down in ""SATC"" history as one of the most polarizing storylines in the franchise. On paper, this could have been a real smash of a storyline: Miranda, in a marriage more dead than Big (sorry, Steve), explores a relationship with a bold, non-binary breath of fresh air. Wonderful! The problem, for me, was how they chose to bring this character to life. Which brings me to...The worstSarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Che Diaz, the character -- I'm not in a place to speak on behalf of any community of which I am not a part, so I will refrain from going too deep on some points here. But everything about Rock (Alexa Swinton), Charlotte and Harry's child, was handled with such grace, which is what made Che Diaz, who is nonbinary, an incredibly jarring presence. Che (Sara Ramirez), a self-described narcassist and so-called comedian, is in many ways the kind of toxic figure I've tried to steer my friends away from for a long time.

(CNN)And just like that, another chapter of ""Sex and the City"" is over. Simply put, this HBO Max revival — which was minus one Samantha and added a lot of new faces — has divided a fandom. (HBO Max, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)""And Just Like That..."" was never going to please everyone. That's just how TV goes. But even those who still prefer to forget the existence of the much-panned films couldn't have predicted the pure volume of hot takes and chilly tweets that this show would inspire week after week. The loudest critics of the revival will say they've continued the 10-episode journey in the form of hate watching, tuning in weekly knowing that they'll be bothered by any number of characters or plot points. But I'd argue most have continued because of something stronger — Sunk Cost Streaming. ""Sex and the City"" loyalists have invested too much time, energy, tears and laughs to just walk away. We're in a committed relationship with Carrie and Co. And because we care, we can't help but wonder until the very end: Can they get it right?Read MoreEveryone's answer will be different, but in the end, here's my take on the best -- and not-so-best -- parts of ""And Just Like That..."": The bestAri Nicole Parker.Wonder(ful) women -- Part of me looks at characters like single realtor Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), fabulous Park Avenue mom Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) and professor Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman) with such sadness. In the original series, any of these women could have carried the meaty storylines of a main cast member season after season. It's a shame this New York City-set world waited so long to literally and figuratively invite women of color to take a seat at the high top, and having them debut in a season where many other storylines had to be served, I feel they were short-changed. Lisa was introduced in a scene in which she ate Carrie's leftover french fries, and I haven't been able to erase the visual from my mind since. This glamorous gazelle deserves a main course. In fact, I wouldn't mind continuing to see more of any of their journeys.Charlotte York Goldenblatt -- Of all the characters, Charlotte was by far the one who seemed like she'd actually lived through the last decade. Yes, she'd experienced it from her million-dollar home, but that's who she is. Every scene and every line of hers felt ripped from the original show -- none perhaps more so than the scene at Lisa's house when she took a long, impressive dive into the reasons her friend's art collection was an incredible investment, defending Lisa against her mother-in-law's criticisms. It was classic Charlotte -- smart, sweet, supportive when it matters, and yes, Carrie, a little smug. (Supportive Charlotte also shined through in the storyline involving her child's desire to explore their gender identity and be referred to by they/them pronouns.) More than anyone else on the show, Charlotte 2022 came across like that special person in your life who evolves but never changes, in the best way.How it handled grief -- The first episodes of ""And Just Like That..."" were by no means easy to watch. You can debate all day long whether they should have killed Big. (Honestly, considering the off-screen drama, the producers are probably happy they did.) But you can't question that Carrie's grief was portrayed raw and real. It served as a reminder that in the grand scheme of life, although Post-It note breakups sting, they are really just paper cuts compared to real pain. Che Diaz, the concept -- Miranda's love affair with Carrie's podcasting boss will go down in ""SATC"" history as one of the most polarizing storylines in the franchise. On paper, this could have been a real smash of a storyline: Miranda, in a marriage more dead than Big (sorry, Steve), explores a relationship with a bold, non-binary breath of fresh air. Wonderful! The problem, for me, was how they chose to bring this character to life. Which brings me to...The worstSarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Che Diaz, the character -- I'm not in a place to speak on behalf of any community of which I am not a part, so I will refrain from going too deep on some points here. But everything about Rock (Alexa Swinton), Charlotte and Harry's child, was handled with such grace, which is what made Che Diaz, who is nonbinary, an incredibly jarring presence. Che (Sara Ramirez), a self-described narcassist and so-called comedian, is in many ways the kind of toxic figure I've tried to steer my friends away from for a long time. The character triggered my friend radar -- beep, beep, this person sucks, beep, beep, retreat, save friend. When portraying any member of an underrepresented community, perfection is not the expectation, but there's a responsibility to make it count. When you don't see yourself on screen a lot -- where my fellow Latinx at? -- you want to feel like the portrayals mean something. On a platform as big as the ""Sex and the City"" franchise, it's hard to see Che as anything other than a gigantic missed opportunity at best and a giant middle finger at worst. Miranda Hobbes -- Miranda's greatest offense in this revival wasn't living her truth; it was not being truthful. I remember wondering mid-way through what I'd missed in the last 10 years that turned Miranda, the woman who respected a culture enough to learn Arabic before a trip to Abu Dhabi, into a person who doesn't respect her very decent husband enough to tell him the truth about where she's at emotionally.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: TV OT is a weekly look at what CNN's entertainment team is watching since too much television has us all working overtime. (CNN)And just like that, another chapter of ""Sex and the City"" is over. Simply put, this HBO Max revival — which was minus one Samantha and added a lot of new faces — has divided a fandom. (HBO Max, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)""And Just Like That..."" was never going to please everyone. That's just how TV goes. But even those who still prefer to forget the existence of the much-panned films couldn't have predicted the pure volume of hot takes and chilly tweets that this show would inspire week after week. The loudest critics of the revival will say they've continued the 10-episode journey in the form of hate watching, tuning in weekly knowing that they'll be bothered by any number of characters or plot points. But I'd argue most have continued because of something stronger — Sunk Cost Streaming. ""Sex and the City"" loyalists have invested too much time, energy, tears and laughs to just walk away. We're in a committed relationship with Carrie and Co. And because we care, we can't help but wonder until the very end: Can they get it right?Read MoreEveryone's answer will be different, but in the end, here's my take on the best -- and not-so-best -- parts of ""And Just Like That..."": The bestAri Nicole Parker.Wonder(ful) women -- Part of me looks at characters like single realtor Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), fabulous Park Avenue mom Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) and professor Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman) with such sadness. In the original series, any of these women could have carried the meaty storylines of a main cast member season after season. It's a shame this New York City-set world waited so long to literally and figuratively invite women of color to take a seat at the high top, and having them debut in a season where many other storylines had to be served, I feel they were short-changed. Lisa was introduced in a scene in which she ate Carrie's leftover french fries, and I haven't been able to erase the visual from my mind since. This glamorous gazelle deserves a main course. In fact, I wouldn't mind continuing to see more of any of their journeys.Charlotte York Goldenblatt -- Of all the characters, Charlotte was by far the one who seemed like she'd actually lived through the last decade. Yes, she'd experienced it from her million-dollar home, but that's who she is. Every scene and every line of hers felt ripped from the original show -- none perhaps more so than the scene at Lisa's house when she took a long, impressive dive into the reasons her friend's art collection was an incredible investment, defending Lisa against her mother-in-law's criticisms. It was classic Charlotte -- smart, sweet, supportive when it matters, and yes, Carrie, a little smug. (Supportive Charlotte also shined through in the storyline involving her child's desire to explore their gender identity and be referred to by they/them pronouns.) More than anyone else on the show, Charlotte 2022 came across like that special person in your life who evolves but never changes, in the best way.How it handled grief -- The first episodes of ""And Just Like That..."" were by no means easy to watch. You can debate all day long whether they should have killed Big. (Honestly, considering the off-screen drama, the producers are probably happy they did.) But you can't question that Carrie's grief was portrayed raw and real. It served as a reminder that in the grand scheme of life, although Post-It note breakups sting, they are really just paper cuts compared to real pain. Che Diaz, the concept -- Miranda's love affair with Carrie's podcasting boss will go down in ""SATC"" history as one of the most polarizing storylines in the franchise. On paper, this could have been a real smash of a storyline: Miranda, in a marriage more dead than Big (sorry, Steve), explores a relationship with a bold, non-binary breath of fresh air. Wonderful! The problem, for me, was how they chose to bring this character to life. Which brings me to...The worstSarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Che Diaz, the character -- I'm not in a place to speak on behalf of any community of which I am not a part, so I will refrain from going too deep on some points here. But everything about Rock (Alexa Swinton), Charlotte and Harry's child, was handled with such grace, which is what made Che Diaz, who is nonbinary, an incredibly jarring presence. Che (Sara Ramirez), a self-described narcassist and so-called comedian, is in many ways the kind of toxic figure I've tried to steer my friends away from for a long time. The character triggered my friend radar -- beep, beep, this person sucks, beep, beep, retreat, save friend. When portraying any member of an underrepresented community, perfection is not the expectation, but there's a responsibility to make it count. When you don't see yourself on screen a lot -- where my fellow Latinx at? -- you want to feel like the portrayals mean something. On a platform as big as the ""Sex and the City"" franchise, it's hard to see Che as anything other than a gigantic missed opportunity at best and a giant middle finger at worst. Miranda Hobbes -- Miranda's greatest offense in this revival wasn't living her truth; it was not being truthful. I remember wondering mid-way through what I'd missed in the last 10 years that turned Miranda, the woman who respected a culture enough to learn Arabic before a trip to Abu Dhabi, into a person who doesn't respect her very decent husband enough to tell him the truth about where she's at emotionally. If Charlotte was the character equivalent of finding your favorite pair of designer heels still fit like a glove, Miranda is that pair of boots you find in the back of your closet that over time have become unrecognizable as something that you once liked. When Miranda called Carrie from a cab and declared, ""I'm in a rom-com!,"" I paused the episode to cringe. ""No, Miranda,"" I thought, ""you're in a tragedy."" She would have been better served as a vehicle for a story about true recovery from alcoholism than ... whatever this was.Brady Hobbes -- I know the subplot about Brady and his girlfriend's boundary-less sex life died off after the first few episodes, but I wish it never existed. It set a terrible tone for the series. Someone should have put this storyline on a Peloton. How they handled Samantha's absence -- We all know Kim Cattrall had no desire to take part in ""And Just Like That...,"" which is a decision its producers had no choice but to respect and work with. They certainly tried their best, but the idea that the women's relationship fell apart over a petty dispute was the hardest pill to swallow. That, and who tells their grieving widow friend that you will talk to them ""soon"" when she asks to speak with you? Not the Samantha I know. Thankfully, we can imagine Carrie and Samantha mending fences in Paris, per the finale. The problem with that?

Read More""But then we want to decide,"" he added, as we were shuffled away by security.  Russia's most controversial arms deal is close, it seems, but not yet finalized. S-300s are impressive weapons, capable of simultaneously tracking and intercepting dozens of airborne targets up to 150 km (93 miles) away. Washington and Israel know they would painfully complicate any future strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. Little wonder, then, that Tehran wants them so badly.  A deal was first done back in 2007, but the Kremlin halted the sale under international pressure.  The revival of the contract comes after a long-negotiated agreement to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. It could open the way for more arms sales, deals on Russian-built civilian airliners, and even a multi-billion dollar network of nuclear reactors that Iran wants built. But for Russia, and President Vladimir Putin, the Iran deal is about more than trade. It sends a key message: the Kremlin has a strategic role to play in the Middle East.  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin's once powerful influence in the region has waned. A series of U.S.-led military interventions in Iraq and Libya, as well as the popular uprisings of the ""Arab Spring,"" also eroded Moscow's leverage. But the tide is starting to turn -- or at least that's what the Kremlin hopes. Russian President Vladimir Putin greets Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at the Kremlin on August 26.In Moscow this week Putin is hosting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi for the third time this year. The two men appear to share a personal bond, as well as an autocratic leadership style. When General el-Sisi overthrew Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2013, the U.S. shunned him.  Putin, by contrast, embraced his fellow strongman. This year, Putin presented el-Sisi with a personalized Kalashnikov, and subsequently boosted trade links with Egypt by 86%, according to the Kremlin, including arms sales. Crucially for the Kremlin, the relationship may be leading to growing Russian diplomatic clout too. El-Sisi hinted as much in Moscow this week.""With each our meeting the people of Egypt look with hope on the perspective of our relations' development in various spheres -- and not only in the sphere of economy, but the sphere of the fight against terrorism, particularly in the region,"" el-Sisi told reporters.  Moscow's overriding area of diplomatic concern is Syria, one of Russia's most longstanding Middle Eastern allies. If the regime of Bashar al-Assad falls --  to ISIS, or any other rebel group -- the Kremlin worries its influence in the region will fall too.  A flurry of diplomatic activity in recent days has seen Putin also host the King of Jordan and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi -- not traditional Kremlin allies -- in an apparent effort to boost trade and woo regional leaders into an anti-ISIS coalition, which would, of course, include the Syrian government.   So far, however, there have been few takers. Moderate Syrian opposition groups, their Saudi Arabian backers, and Washington, are all mistrustful of Russia and balk at Moscow's insistence on keeping al-Assad in power.

It could open the way for more arms sales, deals on Russian-built civilian airliners, and even a multi-billion dollar network of nuclear reactors that Iran wants built. But for Russia, and President Vladimir Putin, the Iran deal is about more than trade. It sends a key message: the Kremlin has a strategic role to play in the Middle East.  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin's once powerful influence in the region has waned. A series of U.S.-led military interventions in Iraq and Libya, as well as the popular uprisings of the ""Arab Spring,"" also eroded Moscow's leverage. But the tide is starting to turn -- or at least that's what the Kremlin hopes. Russian President Vladimir Putin greets Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at the Kremlin on August 26.In Moscow this week Putin is hosting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi for the third time this year. The two men appear to share a personal bond, as well as an autocratic leadership style. When General el-Sisi overthrew Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2013, the U.S. shunned him.  Putin, by contrast, embraced his fellow strongman. This year, Putin presented el-Sisi with a personalized Kalashnikov, and subsequently boosted trade links with Egypt by 86%, according to the Kremlin, including arms sales. Crucially for the Kremlin, the relationship may be leading to growing Russian diplomatic clout too. El-Sisi hinted as much in Moscow this week.""With each our meeting the people of Egypt look with hope on the perspective of our relations' development in various spheres -- and not only in the sphere of economy, but the sphere of the fight against terrorism, particularly in the region,"" el-Sisi told reporters.  Moscow's overriding area of diplomatic concern is Syria, one of Russia's most longstanding Middle Eastern allies. If the regime of Bashar al-Assad falls --  to ISIS, or any other rebel group -- the Kremlin worries its influence in the region will fall too.  A flurry of diplomatic activity in recent days has seen Putin also host the King of Jordan and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi -- not traditional Kremlin allies -- in an apparent effort to boost trade and woo regional leaders into an anti-ISIS coalition, which would, of course, include the Syrian government.   So far, however, there have been few takers. Moderate Syrian opposition groups, their Saudi Arabian backers, and Washington, are all mistrustful of Russia and balk at Moscow's insistence on keeping al-Assad in power. But the Kremlin appears to be carving out a unique and increasingly influential position in a region where it once held sway. Question: Who is in Moscow for the third time this year?"

Putin, by contrast, embraced his fellow strongman. This year, Putin presented el-Sisi with a personalized Kalashnikov, and subsequently boosted trade links with Egypt by 86%, according to the Kremlin, including arms sales. Crucially for the Kremlin, the relationship may be leading to growing Russian diplomatic clout too. El-Sisi hinted as much in Moscow this week.""With each our meeting the people of Egypt look with hope on the perspective of our relations' development in various spheres -- and not only in the sphere of economy, but the sphere of the fight against terrorism, particularly in the region,"" el-Sisi told reporters.  Moscow's overriding area of diplomatic concern is Syria, one of Russia's most longstanding Middle Eastern allies. If the regime of Bashar al-Assad falls --  to ISIS, or any other rebel group -- the Kremlin worries its influence in the region will fall too.  A flurry of diplomatic activity in recent days has seen Putin also host the King of Jordan and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi -- not traditional Kremlin allies -- in an apparent effort to boost trade and woo regional leaders into an anti-ISIS coalition, which would, of course, include the Syrian government.   So far, however, there have been few takers. Moderate Syrian opposition groups, their Saudi Arabian backers, and Washington, are all mistrustful of Russia and balk at Moscow's insistence on keeping al-Assad in power. But the Kremlin appears to be carving out a unique and increasingly influential position in a region where it once held sway. Question: How much has the Kremlin boosted trade links with Egypt?"	The Kremlin has boosted trade links with Egypt by 86%, including arms sales.

""It's imperative our Air Force invests in the right people, technology, capability and training to defend the nation and its interests -- at an affordable cost.""The Pentagon says the LRS-B contract is divided into two parts in an effort to ensure contractors stay on schedule and within the boundaries of designated cost estimates. The first part of the contract covers the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the aircraft and includes incentives to minimize the contractor's profit if it does not control costs and stay on schedule.Engineering and development costs are estimated at $21.4 billion (in 2010 dollars) over the entire life of the program.The second part of the contract covers the costs that go into building each of 100 aircraft projected as part of the program.According to the estimates outlined in the contract, each long-range bomber will cost $511 million (in 2010 dollars), meeting the $550 million threshold set by the Pentagon.Based on current independent estimates, the Air Force projects the cost of the program to be approximately a third of the previous B-2 stealth aircraft.More recent programs to upgrade stealth air capabilities, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, have been plagued by schedule delays, technology glitches and cost overruns.""We have committed to the American people to provide security in the skies, balanced by our responsibility to affordably use taxpayer dollars in doing so,"" said Gen.

Read MoreThese men received 505-year prison sentences each. Now their cases are under new scrutinyWhen the case was before Wilson in August, he denied a request by prosecutors to overturn the men's convictions ""in the interests of justice"" due to special treatment given to a government witness by FBI agents that was not disclosed to the defense. Wilson conducted a months-long review into the matter and concluded that the men's convictions were sufficiently supported by evidence and testimony unrelated to that particular witness. All four defendants filed an appeal with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is pending. But Seresi's attorneys also filed a motion seeking his release on compassionate grounds, due in part to his advanced age and a diagnosis of high blood pressure making him susceptible to serious complications from Covid-19. Prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles did not oppose the motion. While Wilson found that those factors alone did not entitle Seresi to early release, he noted other factors that — taken together — amounted to ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" for granting his freedom. Seresi was convicted of a nonviolent offense, had already served more than 30 years behind bars, earned three associate degrees while incarcerated and had a near spotless disciplinary record, the judge noted.

Following their sentences, the men languished in prison for decades as one appeal after another was denied. But last year they got what seemed like an extraordinary break when federal prosecutors sided with the defense in seeking to have their convictions overturned based on special treatment given to a key government witness by the name of Sergio Hochman. Hochman, a co-conspirator in the drug and money laundering case who cut an early deal with the government, disclosed decades later that agents treated him to a handcuff-free seaside lunch in Malibu and allowed him visits with his wife in the backseat of a car and in her apartment in Tucson, AZ. The benefits were not disclosed to the defense. Prosecutors confirmed the information with Seresi's FBI handlers and ultimately concluded the information was sufficiently damaging to warrant throwing out the case. Wilson, however, launched his own inquiry, which included a review of thousands of pages of documents from the trial. He issued a 32-page ruling in August denying the prosecution's request to overturn the convictions. Wilson said he found that Hochman's testimony had been ""helpful"" to the government, but ""not critical."" ""It's not enough that the government's case would be slightly weaker without Hochman,"" he wrote. Attorney Jerry Newton, who represents Vahe Andonian, praised Wilson's decision to grant Seresi early release and said he believed the Andonian brothers were similarly strong candidates for such mercy. He said he intends to file a similar motion in front of Wilson while their appeal is pending in the 9th Circuit. ""They're essentially around the same age.

All four defendants filed an appeal with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is pending. But Seresi's attorneys also filed a motion seeking his release on compassionate grounds, due in part to his advanced age and a diagnosis of high blood pressure making him susceptible to serious complications from Covid-19. Prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles did not oppose the motion. While Wilson found that those factors alone did not entitle Seresi to early release, he noted other factors that — taken together — amounted to ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" for granting his freedom. Seresi was convicted of a nonviolent offense, had already served more than 30 years behind bars, earned three associate degrees while incarcerated and had a near spotless disciplinary record, the judge noted.

""Very few cases will fall within that provision,"" Wilson wrote. ""Most will not."" ""We are so happy for Juan Carlos and his beautiful family,"" said Reuven Cohen, one of Seresi's lawyers, whose firm took the case on a pro bono basis.Seresi, along with brothers Vahe and Nazareth Andonian and Raul Vivas, were convicted of helping to launder more than $300 million in drug cartel money through their precious metal and money exchange companies.

But last year they got what seemed like an extraordinary break when federal prosecutors sided with the defense in seeking to have their convictions overturned based on special treatment given to a key government witness by the name of Sergio Hochman. Hochman, a co-conspirator in the drug and money laundering case who cut an early deal with the government, disclosed decades later that agents treated him to a handcuff-free seaside lunch in Malibu and allowed him visits with his wife in the backseat of a car and in her apartment in Tucson, AZ. The benefits were not disclosed to the defense. Prosecutors confirmed the information with Seresi's FBI handlers and ultimately concluded the information was sufficiently damaging to warrant throwing out the case. Wilson, however, launched his own inquiry, which included a review of thousands of pages of documents from the trial. He issued a 32-page ruling in August denying the prosecution's request to overturn the convictions. Wilson said he found that Hochman's testimony had been ""helpful"" to the government, but ""not critical."" ""It's not enough that the government's case would be slightly weaker without Hochman,"" he wrote. Attorney Jerry Newton, who represents Vahe Andonian, praised Wilson's decision to grant Seresi early release and said he believed the Andonian brothers were similarly strong candidates for such mercy. He said he intends to file a similar motion in front of Wilson while their appeal is pending in the 9th Circuit. ""They're essentially around the same age.

Hochman, a co-conspirator in the drug and money laundering case who cut an early deal with the government, disclosed decades later that agents treated him to a handcuff-free seaside lunch in Malibu and allowed him visits with his wife in the backseat of a car and in her apartment in Tucson, AZ.

Wilson said he found that Hochman's testimony had been ""helpful"" to the government, but ""not critical."" ""It's not enough that the government's case would be slightly weaker without Hochman,"" he wrote. Attorney Jerry Newton, who represents Vahe Andonian, praised Wilson's decision to grant Seresi early release and said he believed the Andonian brothers were similarly strong candidates for such mercy. He said he intends to file a similar motion in front of Wilson while their appeal is pending in the 9th Circuit. ""They're essentially around the same age.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article:  (CNN)In a stunning reprieve for a man sentenced to more than five centuries behind bars for a nonviolent offense, a judge in Los Angeles on Thursday summarily slashed his sentence to time served and ordered his immediate release. Juan Carlos Seresi, a convicted money launderer whose projected release date from the federal Bureau of Prisons had been July 8, 2419, was suddenly ordered to be freed ""without delay"" by U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson. Once out, Seresi will be subject to a three-year term of supervised release, according to Wilson's order. ""It's a miracle,"" Seresi said after hearing the news from his daughter, Patti Mawer, she told CNN. Mawer, 46, said her father has been behind bars since she was a teenager, but has remained an integral part of her family's life. ""After all this praying and all this hoping, he can't believe it,"" Mawer added. Seresi, 73, was one of four defendants sentenced to 505 years behind bars in 1991 for laundering cocaine cartel cash who were featured in a CNN report published in August. The article noted how the sentences were considered harsh even back then and represent the sort of draconian punishment that has since been widely condemned amid a national conversation around justice reform. Read MoreThese men received 505-year prison sentences each. Now their cases are under new scrutinyWhen the case was before Wilson in August, he denied a request by prosecutors to overturn the men's convictions ""in the interests of justice"" due to special treatment given to a government witness by FBI agents that was not disclosed to the defense. Wilson conducted a months-long review into the matter and concluded that the men's convictions were sufficiently supported by evidence and testimony unrelated to that particular witness. All four defendants filed an appeal with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is pending. But Seresi's attorneys also filed a motion seeking his release on compassionate grounds, due in part to his advanced age and a diagnosis of high blood pressure making him susceptible to serious complications from Covid-19. Prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles did not oppose the motion. While Wilson found that those factors alone did not entitle Seresi to early release, he noted other factors that — taken together — amounted to ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" for granting his freedom.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Berlin (CNN)Central Europe has become the continent's latest coronavirus hotspot, with Austria struggling to contain an outbreak of the new variant first identified in South Africa and neighboring Czech Republic facing hospital bed shortages on top of a political crisis over lockdowns.The worsening situation in the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Czech Republic forced Germany to announce new border controls with both countries to contain the spread of the disease. German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the new rules, which will come into effect on Sunday, were ""unavoidable.""''To protect the population from virus mutations -- this is why the federal government decided yesterday to declare the Czech Republic, Tyrol and Slovakia as coronavirus variant areas,"" Spahn said at a news conference Friday. ""This means there will be a ban on transportation -- and without exceptions tests must be made before entering Germany -- and there is an obligation to quarantine.'Czech teenagers deployed to overwhelmed hospitals as Covid cases explodeCoronavirus cases have been falling in Germany recently despite the new, more contagious variants. On Friday, the country recorded 9,860 new infections -- a drop of 3,048 cases compared to the same day last week. Austria and the Czech Republic have not seen similar drops in cases.

Ivana Kottasová reported and wrote from London.  Question: How many cases has the Czech Republic reported since the start of the pandemic?"	The Czech Republic has reported more than 1 million cases since the start of the pandemic, according to the country's health ministry data.
"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Berlin (CNN)Central Europe has become the continent's latest coronavirus hotspot, with Austria struggling to contain an outbreak of the new variant first identified in South Africa and neighboring Czech Republic facing hospital bed shortages on top of a political crisis over lockdowns.The worsening situation in the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Czech Republic forced Germany to announce new border controls with both countries to contain the spread of the disease. German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the new rules, which will come into effect on Sunday, were ""unavoidable.""''To protect the population from virus mutations -- this is why the federal government decided yesterday to declare the Czech Republic, Tyrol and Slovakia as coronavirus variant areas,"" Spahn said at a news conference Friday. ""This means there will be a ban on transportation -- and without exceptions tests must be made before entering Germany -- and there is an obligation to quarantine.'Czech teenagers deployed to overwhelmed hospitals as Covid cases explodeCoronavirus cases have been falling in Germany recently despite the new, more contagious variants. On Friday, the country recorded 9,860 new infections -- a drop of 3,048 cases compared to the same day last week. Austria and the Czech Republic have not seen similar drops in cases. Read MoreThe Tyrol government said Wednesday that as of Tuesday, it had identified 438 confirmed and suspected cases of the South African variant. Scientists are concerned about this strain because its mutations appear to reduce the efficacy of some of the coronavirus vaccines.In an attempt to contain the spread of the variant, local authorities deployed 1,200 police officers and soldiers. Starting Friday at midnight and lasting for 10 days, they will be deployed to Tyrol's border checkpoints to ensure that anyone trying to leave the province has a negative coronavirus test no older than 48 hours, Tyrol police spokesman Stefan Eder told CNN. Children, freight traffic and travelers transiting through Tyrol are exempt from the rule.Meanwhile in the Czech Republic, the parliament refused to extend the state of emergency on Thursday. As a result, many of the country's coronavirus restrictions are set to lift automatically on Sunday when the current state of emergency expires, despite the fact that the virus continues to spread fast through the country. Czech Health Minister Jan Blatny warned that any easing of restrictions at this point would lead to the health system being at risk of running out of capacity. That is already happening in some hospitals in the country's westernmost Karlovarsky region.Why bad news for AstraZeneca's vaccine is a roadblock on the way out of the pandemicThe decision was a result of a deep political spat between the minority government, led by the populist Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, and the opposition, which has accused Babiš of not doing enough to contain the virus. Among others, the opposition argued that the government's lack of financial support for individuals and businesses impacted by the pandemic means people are not following the rules and are skipping quarantines because they cannot afford to risk losing their income. When Babiš refused to take their proposals on board, the opposition voted against the extension of the state of emergency. The country is holding key parliamentary election later this year.The Czech Republic has reported more than 1 million cases since the start of the pandemic, according to the country's health ministry data.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Melbourne, Australia  (CNN)Agitated and ailing, Novak Djokovic nonetheless won an eighth Australian Open title to beat his fellow Big Three members to the punch in one respect. Chasing Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for most of his career, Djokovic became the first man in the Open Era to win a grand slam title in three decades by downing big-hitter Dominic Thiem 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 6-4 in an unforgettable three-hour, 59-minute final. He has never lost a finale in Melbourne and has now tallied a 17th major overall to pull closer to Federer and Nadal.  ""Obviously at this stage of my career, grand slams are the ones I value the most,"" said Djokovic. ""They are the ones I prioritize. Before the season starts I try to set my form, shape for these events where I can be at my prime tennis, mental and physical abilities.""The elder pair will get their chances to equal the Serb's three-decade accomplishment in 2020 but at the year's first grand slam, he is unquestionably in a class of his own. Read MoreREAD: Kenin wins first grand slam title after beating Muguruza in the Australian Open finalNovak Djokovic celebrates after victory against Austria's Dominic Thiem.Umpire clash Apart from the impressive numbers, the final might be remembered, too, for Djokovic clashing with senior chair umpire Damien Dumusois as he served at 4-4 in the second set. Given a time violation warning by Dumusois -- Djokovic has long taken his time ahead of serves like Nadal -- the Frenchman issued him another warning in the same game when he exceeded the 25-second limit. That meant he was docked a first serve. The same thing happened to Nadal in last year's US Open final, albeit with a different umpire.Djokovic then tapped Dumusois on the shoe as he made his way to his chair. Once seated, he told Dumusois: ""Great job, man. You made yourself famous, well done.""Dumusois was lenient in not penalizing Djokovic further for making contact with him, ensuring things didn't escalate.Djokovic pats the feet of the umpire in a heated exchange. READ: Eliud Kipchoge's record-breaking Nike shoes to be bannedThe last time Djokovic and Thiem met at a grand slam, the 32-year-old also lost his cool when given a time violation in the 2019 French Open semifinals. ""I thought that the second violation was not necessary,"" said Djokovic. ""The first one, fine, no problem. The second one, it's just not necessary under the circumstances for a experienced chair umpire. I thought probably he could have reacted a little bit better in that situation.""Whether he was rocked by Sunday's incident or feeling something physically -- factoring in, too, Thiem's improved play -- Djokovic waned on a nippy Melbourne evening and it felt like an upset was on the cards. But Thiem, now 0-3 in grand slam finals, didn't have any regrets.  ""Of course, there were some small mistakes here and there, but they're happening,"" he said. ""At the end it was a super close five-setter.""Down 4-1 in the third, the trainer visited Djokovic. He later told reporters he felt dizzy and lost his energy. He left the court with the doctor at the end of the set and once he returned, seemed completely re-energized. He additionally mostly put away the drop shot, which fluctuated in its success rate.      Kobe tribute Fifth-ranked Thiem cracked at 3-4 to help Djokovic nab the fourth set and a considerable statistical edge. While Djokovic held a 30-10 record in fifth sets, Thiem was a mediocre 8-6. The trend ultimately continued, Thiem erring to crucially concede serve at 1-2. It was far from over, though, since Thiem manufactured two break points immediately. And he had chances on both, erring on a forehand into the net with Djokovic in trouble and missing a backhand pass long down the line. The latter was more difficult but given Thiem's propensity to hit flashy winners, he'd like the shot back.  Thiem hung on by delivering a potent serve on break point at 2-4, and it was then Djokovic's turn to escape a jam, at 15-30. There was no drama in the final game. Djokovic served it out to 15 when Thiem's forehand went wide. Djokovic gave an emotional speech when receiving his trophy, telling the crowd to ""stick together"" during tough times whilst paying tribute to his ""mentor"" Kobe Bryant. ""There were some devastating things that started 2020, with huge bushfires here in Australia, conflicts in parts of the world with people dying every day,"" he said.  ""One person that I considered close in my life, Kobe Bryant, passed away as well with his daughter. ""This is a reminder that we should stick together more than ever and be with our families. Stay close to the people who love you, that care about you.""Thiem had looked the more likely to win during some points of the match. 17 and counting Djokovic still hasn't lost a match since the year began. Serbia triumphed in the inaugural ATP Cup and, maybe just as important, Djokovic received some of the most vocal fan support of his career. He has always wanted to be loved -- Federer and Nadal surpass him on that front -- and he got his wish. ""It played a role and a factor"" in Djokovic's Australian summer, his coach Marian Vajda told CNN. ""It's an engine.""He seemed to slightly edge the support early in the final, with those on Rod Laver Arena subsequently getting behind Thiem when he fell behind 4-1.  Djokovic recently downplayed the importance of becoming the men's all-time grand slam leader but he'd no doubt still like to get there. He trails Nadal by two and Federer by three. As a bonus, he will usurp Nadal as the world No. 1 in the rankings come Monday.With Djokovic, Nadal and Federer winning the previous 12 majors, Thiem's task was always going to be extremely difficult. ""These guys brought tennis to a complete new level,"" said Thiem. ""They also brought me probably to a much better level. Of course, it would be or it was easier for sure in a different era to win big titles. That's 100%.""But I'm happy I can compete with these guys on the best level. I really hope also that I win my maiden slam when they're still around because it just counts more.""He spent an intense four hours on court in the quarterfinals against Nadal and endured an emotional rollercoaster against Alexander ""Sascha"" Zverev in the last four. Entering the final having played an average of one hour more than Djokovic might have contributed to the result, no matter if the Austrian is considered one of the fittest players on the tour. He gestured, too, that he felt like vomiting in his semifinal. ""I think I've rarely felt physically that tired, especially now after all the tension's gone,"" said Thiem. ""I played an unbelievable intense match against Rafa, such an intense match against Sascha in the semis. Today again I think almost over four hours. I think that was very demanding.""Of course, I just feel a lot of emptiness right now.""All three of Thiem's grand slam defeats have come at the hands of the all conquering Big Three. In Melbourne, no one in the men's game has been better than Djokovic.  Question: Where did Novak Djokovic win his eighth Australian Open title?"

""Obviously at this stage of my career, grand slams are the ones I value the most,"" said Djokovic. ""They are the ones I prioritize. Before the season starts I try to set my form, shape for these events where I can be at my prime tennis, mental and physical abilities.""The elder pair will get their chances to equal the Serb's three-decade accomplishment in 2020 but at the year's first grand slam, he is unquestionably in a class of his own.

Given a time violation warning by Dumusois -- Djokovic has long taken his time ahead of serves like Nadal -- the Frenchman issued him another warning in the same game when he exceeded the 25-second limit. That meant he was docked a first serve. The same thing happened to Nadal in last year's US Open final, albeit with a different umpire.Djokovic then tapped Dumusois on the shoe as he made his way to his chair. Once seated, he told Dumusois: ""Great job, man. You made yourself famous, well done.""Dumusois was lenient in not penalizing Djokovic further for making contact with him, ensuring things didn't escalate.Djokovic pats the feet of the umpire in a heated exchange. READ: Eliud Kipchoge's record-breaking Nike shoes to be bannedThe last time Djokovic and Thiem met at a grand slam, the 32-year-old also lost his cool when given a time violation in the 2019 French Open semifinals. ""I thought that the second violation was not necessary,"" said Djokovic. ""The first one, fine, no problem. The second one, it's just not necessary under the circumstances for a experienced chair umpire. I thought probably he could have reacted a little bit better in that situation.""Whether he was rocked by Sunday's incident or feeling something physically -- factoring in, too, Thiem's improved play -- Djokovic waned on a nippy Melbourne evening and it felt like an upset was on the cards. But Thiem, now 0-3 in grand slam finals, didn't have any regrets.  ""Of course, there were some small mistakes here and there, but they're happening,"" he said. ""At the end it was a super close five-setter.""Down 4-1 in the third, the trainer visited Djokovic. He later told reporters he felt dizzy and lost his energy. He left the court with the doctor at the end of the set and once he returned, seemed completely re-energized. He additionally mostly put away the drop shot, which fluctuated in its success rate.      Kobe tribute Fifth-ranked Thiem cracked at 3-4 to help Djokovic nab the fourth set and a considerable statistical edge. While Djokovic held a 30-10 record in fifth sets, Thiem was a mediocre 8-6. The trend ultimately continued, Thiem erring to crucially concede serve at 1-2. It was far from over, though, since Thiem manufactured two break points immediately. And he had chances on both, erring on a forehand into the net with Djokovic in trouble and missing a backhand pass long down the line. The latter was more difficult but given Thiem's propensity to hit flashy winners, he'd like the shot back.  Thiem hung on by delivering a potent serve on break point at 2-4, and it was then Djokovic's turn to escape a jam, at 15-30. There was no drama in the final game. Djokovic served it out to 15 when Thiem's forehand went wide. Djokovic gave an emotional speech when receiving his trophy, telling the crowd to ""stick together"" during tough times whilst paying tribute to his ""mentor"" Kobe Bryant. ""There were some devastating things that started 2020, with huge bushfires here in Australia, conflicts in parts of the world with people dying every day,"" he said.  ""One person that I considered close in my life, Kobe Bryant, passed away as well with his daughter. ""This is a reminder that we should stick together more than ever and be with our families. Stay close to the people who love you, that care about you.""Thiem had looked the more likely to win during some points of the match. 17 and counting Djokovic still hasn't lost a match since the year began. Serbia triumphed in the inaugural ATP Cup and, maybe just as important, Djokovic received some of the most vocal fan support of his career. He has always wanted to be loved -- Federer and Nadal surpass him on that front -- and he got his wish. ""It played a role and a factor"" in Djokovic's Australian summer, his coach Marian Vajda told CNN. ""It's an engine.""He seemed to slightly edge the support early in the final, with those on Rod Laver Arena subsequently getting behind Thiem when he fell behind 4-1.  Djokovic recently downplayed the importance of becoming the men's all-time grand slam leader but he'd no doubt still like to get there. He trails Nadal by two and Federer by three. As a bonus, he will usurp Nadal as the world No. 1 in the rankings come Monday.With Djokovic, Nadal and Federer winning the previous 12 majors, Thiem's task was always going to be extremely difficult. ""These guys brought tennis to a complete new level,"" said Thiem. ""They also brought me probably to a much better level. Of course, it would be or it was easier for sure in a different era to win big titles. That's 100%.""But I'm happy I can compete with these guys on the best level. I really hope also that I win my maiden slam when they're still around because it just counts more.""He spent an intense four hours on court in the quarterfinals against Nadal and endured an emotional rollercoaster against Alexander ""Sascha"" Zverev in the last four. Entering the final having played an average of one hour more than Djokovic might have contributed to the result, no matter if the Austrian is considered one of the fittest players on the tour. He gestured, too, that he felt like vomiting in his semifinal. ""I think I've rarely felt physically that tired, especially now after all the tension's gone,"" said Thiem. ""I played an unbelievable intense match against Rafa, such an intense match against Sascha in the semis. Today again I think almost over four hours. I think that was very demanding.""Of course, I just feel a lot of emptiness right now.""All three of Thiem's grand slam defeats have come at the hands of the all conquering Big Three. In Melbourne, no one in the men's game has been better than Djokovic.  Question: What happened to Nadal in last year's US Open final?"

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Melbourne, Australia  (CNN)Agitated and ailing, Novak Djokovic nonetheless won an eighth Australian Open title to beat his fellow Big Three members to the punch in one respect. Chasing Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for most of his career, Djokovic became the first man in the Open Era to win a grand slam title in three decades by downing big-hitter Dominic Thiem 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 6-4 in an unforgettable three-hour, 59-minute final. He has never lost a finale in Melbourne and has now tallied a 17th major overall to pull closer to Federer and Nadal.  ""Obviously at this stage of my career, grand slams are the ones I value the most,"" said Djokovic. ""They are the ones I prioritize. Before the season starts I try to set my form, shape for these events where I can be at my prime tennis, mental and physical abilities.""The elder pair will get their chances to equal the Serb's three-decade accomplishment in 2020 but at the year's first grand slam, he is unquestionably in a class of his own.

Given a time violation warning by Dumusois -- Djokovic has long taken his time ahead of serves like Nadal -- the Frenchman issued him another warning in the same game when he exceeded the 25-second limit. That meant he was docked a first serve. The same thing happened to Nadal in last year's US Open final, albeit with a different umpire.Djokovic then tapped Dumusois on the shoe as he made his way to his chair. Once seated, he told Dumusois: ""Great job, man. You made yourself famous, well done.""Dumusois was lenient in not penalizing Djokovic further for making contact with him, ensuring things didn't escalate.Djokovic pats the feet of the umpire in a heated exchange.

""I thought that the second violation was not necessary,"" said Djokovic. ""The first one, fine, no problem. The second one, it's just not necessary under the circumstances for a experienced chair umpire. I thought probably he could have reacted a little bit better in that situation.""Whether he was rocked by Sunday's incident or feeling something physically -- factoring in, too, Thiem's improved play -- Djokovic waned on a nippy Melbourne evening and it felt like an upset was on the cards. But Thiem, now 0-3 in grand slam finals, didn't have any regrets.  ""Of course, there were some small mistakes here and there, but they're happening,"" he said. ""At the end it was a super close five-setter.""Down 4-1 in the third, the trainer visited Djokovic. He later told reporters he felt dizzy and lost his energy. He left the court with the doctor at the end of the set and once he returned, seemed completely re-energized. He additionally mostly put away the drop shot, which fluctuated in its success rate.      Kobe tribute Fifth-ranked Thiem cracked at 3-4 to help Djokovic nab the fourth set and a considerable statistical edge. While Djokovic held a 30-10 record in fifth sets, Thiem was a mediocre 8-6. The trend ultimately continued, Thiem erring to crucially concede serve at 1-2. It was far from over, though, since Thiem manufactured two break points immediately. And he had chances on both, erring on a forehand into the net with Djokovic in trouble and missing a backhand pass long down the line. The latter was more difficult but given Thiem's propensity to hit flashy winners, he'd like the shot back.  Thiem hung on by delivering a potent serve on break point at 2-4, and it was then Djokovic's turn to escape a jam, at 15-30. There was no drama in the final game. Djokovic served it out to 15 when Thiem's forehand went wide. Djokovic gave an emotional speech when receiving his trophy, telling the crowd to ""stick together"" during tough times whilst paying tribute to his ""mentor"" Kobe Bryant.

READ: Eliud Kipchoge's record-breaking Nike shoes to be bannedThe last time Djokovic and Thiem met at a grand slam, the 32-year-old also lost his cool when given a time violation in the 2019 French Open semifinals. ""I thought that the second violation was not necessary,"" said Djokovic. ""The first one, fine, no problem. The second one, it's just not necessary under the circumstances for a experienced chair umpire. I thought probably he could have reacted a little bit better in that situation.""Whether he was rocked by Sunday's incident or feeling something physically -- factoring in, too, Thiem's improved play -- Djokovic waned on a nippy Melbourne evening and it felt like an upset was on the cards. But Thiem, now 0-3 in grand slam finals, didn't have any regrets.  ""Of course, there were some small mistakes here and there, but they're happening,"" he said. ""At the end it was a super close five-setter.""Down 4-1 in the third, the trainer visited Djokovic. He later told reporters he felt dizzy and lost his energy. He left the court with the doctor at the end of the set and once he returned, seemed completely re-energized. He additionally mostly put away the drop shot, which fluctuated in its success rate.      Kobe tribute Fifth-ranked Thiem cracked at 3-4 to help Djokovic nab the fourth set and a considerable statistical edge. While Djokovic held a 30-10 record in fifth sets, Thiem was a mediocre 8-6. The trend ultimately continued, Thiem erring to crucially concede serve at 1-2. It was far from over, though, since Thiem manufactured two break points immediately. And he had chances on both, erring on a forehand into the net with Djokovic in trouble and missing a backhand pass long down the line. The latter was more difficult but given Thiem's propensity to hit flashy winners, he'd like the shot back.  Thiem hung on by delivering a potent serve on break point at 2-4, and it was then Djokovic's turn to escape a jam, at 15-30. There was no drama in the final game. Djokovic served it out to 15 when Thiem's forehand went wide. Djokovic gave an emotional speech when receiving his trophy, telling the crowd to ""stick together"" during tough times whilst paying tribute to his ""mentor"" Kobe Bryant. ""There were some devastating things that started 2020, with huge bushfires here in Australia, conflicts in parts of the world with people dying every day,"" he said.  ""One person that I considered close in my life, Kobe Bryant, passed away as well with his daughter. ""This is a reminder that we should stick together more than ever and be with our families. Stay close to the people who love you, that care about you.""Thiem had looked the more likely to win during some points of the match. 17 and counting Djokovic still hasn't lost a match since the year began. Serbia triumphed in the inaugural ATP Cup and, maybe just as important, Djokovic received some of the most vocal fan support of his career. He has always wanted to be loved -- Federer and Nadal surpass him on that front -- and he got his wish. ""It played a role and a factor"" in Djokovic's Australian summer, his coach Marian Vajda told CNN. ""It's an engine.""He seemed to slightly edge the support early in the final, with those on Rod Laver Arena subsequently getting behind Thiem when he fell behind 4-1.  Djokovic recently downplayed the importance of becoming the men's all-time grand slam leader but he'd no doubt still like to get there. He trails Nadal by two and Federer by three. As a bonus, he will usurp Nadal as the world No. 1 in the rankings come Monday.With Djokovic, Nadal and Federer winning the previous 12 majors, Thiem's task was always going to be extremely difficult. ""These guys brought tennis to a complete new level,"" said Thiem. ""They also brought me probably to a much better level. Of course, it would be or it was easier for sure in a different era to win big titles. That's 100%.""But I'm happy I can compete with these guys on the best level. I really hope also that I win my maiden slam when they're still around because it just counts more.""He spent an intense four hours on court in the quarterfinals against Nadal and endured an emotional rollercoaster against Alexander ""Sascha"" Zverev in the last four. Entering the final having played an average of one hour more than Djokovic might have contributed to the result, no matter if the Austrian is considered one of the fittest players on the tour. He gestured, too, that he felt like vomiting in his semifinal. ""I think I've rarely felt physically that tired, especially now after all the tension's gone,"" said Thiem. ""I played an unbelievable intense match against Rafa, such an intense match against Sascha in the semis. Today again I think almost over four hours. I think that was very demanding.""Of course, I just feel a lot of emptiness right now.""All three of Thiem's grand slam defeats have come at the hands of the all conquering Big Three. In Melbourne, no one in the men's game has been better than Djokovic.  Question: What did he say?"	"""Of course, there were some small mistakes here and there, but they're happening,"" he said."

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Melbourne, Australia  (CNN)Agitated and ailing, Novak Djokovic nonetheless won an eighth Australian Open title to beat his fellow Big Three members to the punch in one respect. Chasing Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for most of his career, Djokovic became the first man in the Open Era to win a grand slam title in three decades by downing big-hitter Dominic Thiem 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 6-4 in an unforgettable three-hour, 59-minute final. He has never lost a finale in Melbourne and has now tallied a 17th major overall to pull closer to Federer and Nadal.  ""Obviously at this stage of my career, grand slams are the ones I value the most,"" said Djokovic. ""They are the ones I prioritize. Before the season starts I try to set my form, shape for these events where I can be at my prime tennis, mental and physical abilities.""The elder pair will get their chances to equal the Serb's three-decade accomplishment in 2020 but at the year's first grand slam, he is unquestionably in a class of his own.

Given a time violation warning by Dumusois -- Djokovic has long taken his time ahead of serves like Nadal -- the Frenchman issued him another warning in the same game when he exceeded the 25-second limit. That meant he was docked a first serve. The same thing happened to Nadal in last year's US Open final, albeit with a different umpire.Djokovic then tapped Dumusois on the shoe as he made his way to his chair. Once seated, he told Dumusois: ""Great job, man. You made yourself famous, well done.""Dumusois was lenient in not penalizing Djokovic further for making contact with him, ensuring things didn't escalate.Djokovic pats the feet of the umpire in a heated exchange.

""I thought that the second violation was not necessary,"" said Djokovic. ""The first one, fine, no problem. The second one, it's just not necessary under the circumstances for a experienced chair umpire. I thought probably he could have reacted a little bit better in that situation.""Whether he was rocked by Sunday's incident or feeling something physically -- factoring in, too, Thiem's improved play -- Djokovic waned on a nippy Melbourne evening and it felt like an upset was on the cards. But Thiem, now 0-3 in grand slam finals, didn't have any regrets.  ""Of course, there were some small mistakes here and there, but they're happening,"" he said. ""At the end it was a super close five-setter.""Down 4-1 in the third, the trainer visited Djokovic. He later told reporters he felt dizzy and lost his energy. He left the court with the doctor at the end of the set and once he returned, seemed completely re-energized. He additionally mostly put away the drop shot, which fluctuated in its success rate.      Kobe tribute Fifth-ranked Thiem cracked at 3-4 to help Djokovic nab the fourth set and a considerable statistical edge. While Djokovic held a 30-10 record in fifth sets, Thiem was a mediocre 8-6. The trend ultimately continued, Thiem erring to crucially concede serve at 1-2. It was far from over, though, since Thiem manufactured two break points immediately. And he had chances on both, erring on a forehand into the net with Djokovic in trouble and missing a backhand pass long down the line. The latter was more difficult but given Thiem's propensity to hit flashy winners, he'd like the shot back.  Thiem hung on by delivering a potent serve on break point at 2-4, and it was then Djokovic's turn to escape a jam, at 15-30. There was no drama in the final game. Djokovic served it out to 15 when Thiem's forehand went wide. Djokovic gave an emotional speech when receiving his trophy, telling the crowd to ""stick together"" during tough times whilst paying tribute to his ""mentor"" Kobe Bryant. ""There were some devastating things that started 2020, with huge bushfires here in Australia, conflicts in parts of the world with people dying every day,"" he said.  ""One person that I considered close in my life, Kobe Bryant, passed away as well with his daughter. ""This is a reminder that we should stick together more than ever and be with our families. Stay close to the people who love you, that care about you.""Thiem had looked the more likely to win during some points of the match. 17 and counting Djokovic still hasn't lost a match since the year began. Serbia triumphed in the inaugural ATP Cup and, maybe just as important, Djokovic received some of the most vocal fan support of his career. He has always wanted to be loved -- Federer and Nadal surpass him on that front -- and he got his wish. ""It played a role and a factor"" in Djokovic's Australian summer, his coach Marian Vajda told CNN. ""It's an engine.""He seemed to slightly edge the support early in the final, with those on Rod Laver Arena subsequently getting behind Thiem when he fell behind 4-1.  Djokovic recently downplayed the importance of becoming the men's all-time grand slam leader but he'd no doubt still like to get there. He trails Nadal by two and Federer by three. As a bonus, he will usurp Nadal as the world No. 1 in the rankings come Monday.With Djokovic, Nadal and Federer winning the previous 12 majors, Thiem's task was always going to be extremely difficult. ""These guys brought tennis to a complete new level,"" said Thiem. ""They also brought me probably to a much better level. Of course, it would be or it was easier for sure in a different era to win big titles. That's 100%.""But I'm happy I can compete with these guys on the best level.

The trend ultimately continued, Thiem erring to crucially concede serve at 1-2. It was far from over, though, since Thiem manufactured two break points immediately. And he had chances on both, erring on a forehand into the net with Djokovic in trouble and missing a backhand pass long down the line. The latter was more difficult but given Thiem's propensity to hit flashy winners, he'd like the shot back.  Thiem hung on by delivering a potent serve on break point at 2-4, and it was then Djokovic's turn to escape a jam, at 15-30. There was no drama in the final game. Djokovic served it out to 15 when Thiem's forehand went wide. Djokovic gave an emotional speech when receiving his trophy, telling the crowd to ""stick together"" during tough times whilst paying tribute to his ""mentor"" Kobe Bryant. ""There were some devastating things that started 2020, with huge bushfires here in Australia, conflicts in parts of the world with people dying every day,"" he said.  ""One person that I considered close in my life, Kobe Bryant, passed away as well with his daughter. ""This is a reminder that we should stick together more than ever and be with our families. Stay close to the people who love you, that care about you.""Thiem had looked the more likely to win during some points of the match. 17 and counting Djokovic still hasn't lost a match since the year began. Serbia triumphed in the inaugural ATP Cup and, maybe just as important, Djokovic received some of the most vocal fan support of his career. He has always wanted to be loved -- Federer and Nadal surpass him on that front -- and he got his wish. ""It played a role and a factor"" in Djokovic's Australian summer, his coach Marian Vajda told CNN. ""It's an engine.""He seemed to slightly edge the support early in the final, with those on Rod Laver Arena subsequently getting behind Thiem when he fell behind 4-1.  Djokovic recently downplayed the importance of becoming the men's all-time grand slam leader but he'd no doubt still like to get there. He trails Nadal by two and Federer by three. As a bonus, he will usurp Nadal as the world No. 1 in the rankings come Monday.With Djokovic, Nadal and Federer winning the previous 12 majors, Thiem's task was always going to be extremely difficult. ""These guys brought tennis to a complete new level,"" said Thiem. ""They also brought me probably to a much better level. Of course, it would be or it was easier for sure in a different era to win big titles. That's 100%.""But I'm happy I can compete with these guys on the best level. I really hope also that I win my maiden slam when they're still around because it just counts more.""He spent an intense four hours on court in the quarterfinals against Nadal and endured an emotional rollercoaster against Alexander ""Sascha"" Zverev in the last four. Entering the final having played an average of one hour more than Djokovic might have contributed to the result, no matter if the Austrian is considered one of the fittest players on the tour. He gestured, too, that he felt like vomiting in his semifinal. ""I think I've rarely felt physically that tired, especially now after all the tension's gone,"" said Thiem. ""I played an unbelievable intense match against Rafa, such an intense match against Sascha in the semis. Today again I think almost over four hours. I think that was very demanding.""Of course, I just feel a lot of emptiness right now.""All three of Thiem's grand slam defeats have come at the hands of the all conquering Big Three. In Melbourne, no one in the men's game has been better than Djokovic.  Question: Did he feel emptiness right now?"	"""Of course, I just feel a lot of emptiness right now."
"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Melbourne, Australia  (CNN)Agitated and ailing, Novak Djokovic nonetheless won an eighth Australian Open title to beat his fellow Big Three members to the punch in one respect. Chasing Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for most of his career, Djokovic became the first man in the Open Era to win a grand slam title in three decades by downing big-hitter Dominic Thiem 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 6-4 in an unforgettable three-hour, 59-minute final. He has never lost a finale in Melbourne and has now tallied a 17th major overall to pull closer to Federer and Nadal.  ""Obviously at this stage of my career, grand slams are the ones I value the most,"" said Djokovic. ""They are the ones I prioritize. Before the season starts I try to set my form, shape for these events where I can be at my prime tennis, mental and physical abilities.""The elder pair will get their chances to equal the Serb's three-decade accomplishment in 2020 but at the year's first grand slam, he is unquestionably in a class of his own.

Given a time violation warning by Dumusois -- Djokovic has long taken his time ahead of serves like Nadal -- the Frenchman issued him another warning in the same game when he exceeded the 25-second limit. That meant he was docked a first serve. The same thing happened to Nadal in last year's US Open final, albeit with a different umpire.Djokovic then tapped Dumusois on the shoe as he made his way to his chair. Once seated, he told Dumusois: ""Great job, man. You made yourself famous, well done.""Dumusois was lenient in not penalizing Djokovic further for making contact with him, ensuring things didn't escalate.Djokovic pats the feet of the umpire in a heated exchange.

""I thought that the second violation was not necessary,"" said Djokovic. ""The first one, fine, no problem. The second one, it's just not necessary under the circumstances for a experienced chair umpire. I thought probably he could have reacted a little bit better in that situation.""Whether he was rocked by Sunday's incident or feeling something physically -- factoring in, too, Thiem's improved play -- Djokovic waned on a nippy Melbourne evening and it felt like an upset was on the cards. But Thiem, now 0-3 in grand slam finals, didn't have any regrets.  ""Of course, there were some small mistakes here and there, but they're happening,"" he said. ""At the end it was a super close five-setter.""Down 4-1 in the third, the trainer visited Djokovic. He later told reporters he felt dizzy and lost his energy. He left the court with the doctor at the end of the set and once he returned, seemed completely re-energized. He additionally mostly put away the drop shot, which fluctuated in its success rate.

Another of Rupert Murdoch's former newspaper chiefs, Rebekah Brooks, was unanimously cleared of all charges Tuesday after the eight-month trial at the Old Bailey court.Shortly before the jury was discharged, the judge in the case, John Saunders, issued an unusual rebuke to Prime Minister David Cameron and ""a large number of politicians from all parties"" for commenting on the case after the partial verdicts Tuesday.JUST WATCHEDDetails of royal messages revealed ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDetails of royal messages revealed  02:48JUST WATCHEDPhone hacking trial has UK media buzzingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPhone hacking trial has UK media buzzing 05:57JUST WATCHEDMurdoch's empire under fireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMurdoch's empire under fire 04:10""I consider that what has happened is unsatisfactory so far as justice and the rule of law are concerned,"" Saunders said in his ruling. ""The press in court have been extremely responsible in their reporting of this case but when politicians regard it as open season, one cannot expect the press to remain silent.""The ruling followed an application for the jury to be discharged on the basis that it was no longer possible for Coulson and Goodman to have a fair trial because of those comments.But the judge said he had decided not to discharge the jury on those grounds. ""I am satisfied that the jury will continue to try Mr. Coulson and Mr. Goodman on the evidence that they have heard in court and solely on that evidence,"" he said.A spokesman for the Prime Minister's office said that Cameron had taken the ""best legal advice"" before giving a statement Tuesday.Cameron: 'Wrong decision'Speaking before the House of Commons on Wednesday, Cameron repeated the apology he'd made a day earlier for hiring Coulson as his director of communications in 2007.""I am sorry, this was the wrong decision, but I think it's right that we've had a public inquiry in this country, and it's right that we have proper investigations,"" he said. ""Yesterday once again showed that no one is above the law in our country.""Public and political outrage over the hacking revelations led to the closure of the 168-year-old News of the World paper and the setting up of a public inquiry to examine journalistic ethics, known as the Leveson Inquiry, as well as a police investigation.In a statement Wednesday, Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner who oversaw the investigation, said it had been ""complex and challenging"" -- and that officers involved had been aware of the ""sensitivities"" of investigating a national newspaper and confidential journalistic material.""This investigation has never been about an attack on press freedom but one to establish whether any criminal offenses had been committed, to establish who was responsible for committing them and to bring them to justice. The victims deserved no less,"" she said.""Along with the verdicts, I hope this will give some comfort to the many victims that justice has been served.""The Metropolitan Police investigation into phone hacking, which was launched in January 2011 and dubbed Operation Weeting, identified 5,500 victims. Of those, 3,500 have been contacted, a police statement said.The investigation involved sifting through millions of e-mails, tens of thousands of documents, other data communications and financial transactions, it said.Murdered schoolgirlTuesday's verdicts came three years after it was revealed that journalists on News of the World hacked the voice mail of then-missing teenager Milly Dowler in 2002, raising hopes that she was alive and checking messages, when in fact she had been murdered.At the time the schoolgirl's voice mail was intercepted, Brooks was editor of Britain's top-selling News of the World, and Coulson was her deputy. After Coulson succeeded her as editor, Brooks edited The Sun newspaper, and she later became chief executive of the parent company, News International -- now known as News UK.Coulson resigned as News of the World editor in 2007 after its then-royal editor, Goodman, and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed for hacking into voice-mail messages left for royal aides.Coulson denied any wrongdoing and later became Cameron's director of communications. The former editor resigned from his Downing Street position in 2011 as coverage of the phone hacking scandal broadened.'Wrongdoing occurred'Besides a charge of conspiracy to hack voice mails, Brooks also was accused of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, as was her husband, Charlie Brooks, and her former personal assistant, Cheryl Carter. All three were cleared of those charges, the Press Association reported, as was former News International head of security Mark Hanna.Retired managing editor Stuart Kuttner was cleared of conspiracy to hack phones.Five people pleaded guilty to phone hacking charges before the case came to trial, the police said. They were Mulcaire, Neville Thurlbeck, Greg Miskiw, James Weatherup and Daniel Evans.News UK, the UK newspaper publishing arm of Murdoch's News Corp., said in a statement: ""We said long ago, and repeat today, that wrongdoing occurred, and we apologized for it. We have been paying compensation to those affected and have cooperated with investigations.""The publisher said it was making changes to ensure this kind of wrongdoing did not recur and that it supported a new UK press watchdog expected to start work later this year.Read: 7 amazing things we learned during the hacking trialRead: UK phone hacking trial: Who is Andy Coulson?Read: Phone hacking scandal: Who is Rebekah Brooks?

A spokesperson for the tech giant said: ""Our systems run in the background and automatically remove and report intimate content involving children to (the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children) in the US, who in turn will review and dispatch the relevant information to the right law enforcement agencies across the globe.""Last year, Facebook attracted criticism for asking potential victims of revenge porn to preemptively send explicit images of themselves to the social network, allowing Facebook to build a digital profile of the pictures and then prevent them being shared by anyone else.

In December, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a brief objecting to the prosecution of a Minnesota 15-year-old for sharing a naked photo of herself.""Sexting is not without consequences—but all teenagers make mistakes. There are ways for parents, schools, and communities to respond to sexting without criminalizing young people, jeopardizing their futures, and undermining the real pursuit and prosecution of those who exploit children,"" the ACLU said at the time.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Story highlightsHIV killed more than 14,000 people by the end of the 1980sThe public panicked, not knowing how it spread The LGBT community often had to fill in gaps in care as so many gay men died and others were isolated (CNN)In the 1980s, when Dr. Jesse Peel was in his 40s, he realized something startling: The gay community organizer and psychiatrist in Atlanta had lost more of his contemporaries than his aging mother at the time. It was the height of the AIDS epidemic. Peel said he would sometimes attend two or three funerals for friends in a week. People were getting sick, deathly sick, long before the disease even had a name. Quiz: How well do you know the '80s?His journals from the time capture this loss and hint at fear people had of the disease and of his community. Not knowing how it spread, people in the 1980s worried that they'd get sick from holding hands or catch the disease from a public toilet seat. There were no tests and no real treatments. The disease struck so many young men so quickly, and it seemed to target the gay community, so much that its first name was gay-related immune deficiency. Some just called it ""gay cancer.""Hollywood's struggle to deal with AIDS in the '80sPeel's journal also documents his growing desire to be an activist. In the 1980s, people were so afraid of the disease, nurses refused to take in meals to hospitalized patients. Doctors in major medical journals debated whether they had a moral obligation to treat people with AIDS. Parents refused to see their sick children, and faith communities called patients with HIV an ""abomination."" Peel and others like him helped start organizations that would fill in the gaps of care.Read MorePeel donated his journals to a special collection at the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library at Emory University in Atlanta. The collection of personal papers and mementos from the AIDS movement, part of a broader LGBT collection, gives readers an intimate glimpse of the epidemic as it unfolded and as the LGBT movement gained momentum.Timeline: AIDS moments to rememberSan Francisco and New York will always be inextricably linked to the early AIDS movement, but people in Atlanta also played a unique role, one that's often overlooked. The city is home to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which, in 1981, first documented what was then a mysterious disease. Some members of the Reagan administration famously refused to even mention the word AIDS until 1985, and by then, the epidemic was too big to ignore, with 15,948 cases. It was the CDC that created a hotline to answer scared people's questions. The agency tracked case numbers and developed research to better understand the virus.HIV in the '80s: 'People didn't want to kiss you on the cheek'In 1989, Atlanta-based Nexus Press hosted what is believed to be the first art exhibition in the United States to focus solely on AIDS. It was an Atlanta theater that, in 1984, staged what is thought to be the first AIDS-themed play, ""Warren."" Rebecca Ranson's original manuscript, which is housed at the Emory archive, tells a story about her friend who was dying from the disease and how she, a lesbian, and other friends tried to help. The play was performed throughout the country and at the CDC's first International conference about AIDS held in Atlanta in 1985. It aimed to educate a broader public that might have had little firsthand experience with the epidemic. The program lists AIDS organizations and their phone numbers on the back. And it was an Atlantan who was at the heart of the gay rights case Bowers v. Hardwick. An officer arrested Michael Hardwick for sodomy after the officer observed Hardwick having sex with another man in his own bedroom. The 1986 U.S. Supreme Court decision declared Georgia laws that prohibited sodomy constitutional. In 2003, the Supreme Court reversed that decision. Hardwick died in 1991 due to complications from AIDS.Anger over the case inspired some in the local community to get more involved in organizing public protests such as the 1987 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. The march was attended by more than 200,000 and was the largest of its kind at the time. The program from the march, also housed at the archive, calls for a national response to increase funding for AIDS research and asks for an end to discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS. Some of the local organizers pictured in the program would later become a part of the city's political establishment.Join the conversationSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Peel said AIDS in the 1980s changed Atlanta. The city was always a magnet for LGBT individuals who left their smaller towns for the more liberated city, but before the epidemic, ""for many guys, it was all about sex, drugs, and rock and roll,"" it wasn't about being a part of a broader civil rights movement, Peel told an interviewer. The disease and the public's reaction to it changed that.""We didn't have a gay center then or much in the way of gay organizations. We had to make them up as we went along, and people came together to take care of their friends who were sick and dying,"" he said. ""As the epidemic unfolded, it began to bring people together.""   Question: What year was the height of the AIDS epidemic?"	The 1980s were the height of the AIDS epidemic.

The roughly 60-foot space rock plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 early nuclear bombs. Of the roughly 100 fragments found so far, the biggest weighs about 11 pounds (5 kilograms), said Maria Gritsevich, a researcher at the University of Helsinki.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Story highlightsAncient trash is an important resource for archaeologistsTrash pits or ""middens"" tell us much about the daily life of our forebears, according to archaeologistsPeabody Museum is staging a series of lectures about the importance of trash to archaeologyScientists are studying our trash right now  to find out what it says about our cultureWe may not immediately equate the activities of archaeologists to trash sifting. Or imagine that the glass-encased artifacts in museums might be one-time refuse. But quite often, this is exactly the case. Studying ancient trash from around the world gives archaeologists and historians the chance to understand the habits that defined people's daily lives, said Dr. Richard Meadow, Director of the Peabody Museum's Zooarchaeology Laboratory and Senior Lecturer on Anthropology at Harvard University.It may not be glamorous but, he said, ""much of what archaeology knows about the past comes from trash, if trash is defined as the products of human consumption. Trash is a proxy for human behavior.""The Peabody Museum is staging a series of talks and events, entitled Trash Talk: The Anthropology of Waste until Spring 2012, on the importance of trash to our understanding of human behavior, both in the past and now. Meadow, who has excavated sites including the ancient Indus city of Harappa in present-day Pakistan, has gleaned much from studying centuries-old trash. Early dumping grounds, or ""middens,"" are often archaeological and anthropological gold-mines, he said, not just for what can be found there but for what they tell us about ancient civilizations, what they consumed and how they organized their urban space to deal with their waste.""The way that ancient cities used to grow and change through time is actually very much related to the evolution of trash,"" Meadow explained. Ancient people, he said, quite literally lived with their trash, usually dumping it in the streets outside their homes when it wasn't collected and deposited in special pits. Sometimes, he said, whole cities would be filled with trash, to the point where the street levels would rise, submerging homes and forcing people to build on top of it.  While this might sound revolting and unhygienic to us now, ancient peoples, said Meadow, became acclimatized to it. And they were at least adept at recycling their trash. ""I think almost all civilizations recycled in one way or another,"" Meadow said, explaining that ancient peoples across the world would recycle organic matter as fuel, while inorganic refuse would be used to build the foundations of a house. Precious metals, he said, would be melted down and re-shaped for a variety of tools. ""It's only when you get to the modern period of consumerism that you get this culture of obsolescence,"" he said. Dr. Jose Remesal Rodriguez is a professor of Ancient History at the University of Barcelona and an expert in the social and economic history of the Roman Empire, with a special interest in the production and trade of food in the ancient world.He is the director of excavations at an ancient dump site in Rome called Monte Testaccio. An artificial hill composed of more than 25 million discarded Roman amphorae -- or vase-shaped containers -- it tells us much about the ancient Roman trade in olive oil, which these amphorae were used to transport. ""A dump can be a particularly interesting source (for finding out) about the daily life (and) development of the civilization that created it,"" said Remesal. From the shards found at Monte Testaccio, he said, archaeologists were able to trace the evolution of food policy in the Roman Empire. ""Testaccio is a very special dump, which gives us information about a concrete product -- olive oil -- and the relations between the capital of the Empire and one of its provinces,"" Remesal explained. This prizing of ancient trash may seem at odds with our attitudes to waste today. But according to Meadow, scientists are already at work studying our trash and what it says about us. He cites as an example American archaeologist William Rathje, director of the ""Garbage Project"" in Arizona, which has sifted through and studied garbage from 1973 to the present day.  ""Some amazing statistics have come out of this -- how much food gets thrown out in the trash that was probably OK to eat, and other things hardly used that were thrown away,"" said Meadow.""It's an incredible array of material,"" he concluded.   Question: What is the name of the lecture?"	The Peabody Museum is staging a series of lectures about the importance of trash to archaeology.

Trash is a proxy for human behavior.""The Peabody Museum is staging a series of talks and events, entitled Trash Talk: The Anthropology of Waste until Spring 2012, on the importance of trash to our understanding of human behavior, both in the past and now. Meadow, who has excavated sites including the ancient Indus city of Harappa in present-day Pakistan, has gleaned much from studying centuries-old trash. Early dumping grounds, or ""middens,"" are often archaeological and anthropological gold-mines, he said, not just for what can be found there but for what they tell us about ancient civilizations, what they consumed and how they organized their urban space to deal with their waste.""The way that ancient cities used to grow and change through time is actually very much related to the evolution of trash,"" Meadow explained. Ancient people, he said, quite literally lived with their trash, usually dumping it in the streets outside their homes when it wasn't collected and deposited in special pits. Sometimes, he said, whole cities would be filled with trash, to the point where the street levels would rise, submerging homes and forcing people to build on top of it.  While this might sound revolting and unhygienic to us now, ancient peoples, said Meadow, became acclimatized to it. And they were at least adept at recycling their trash. ""I think almost all civilizations recycled in one way or another,"" Meadow said, explaining that ancient peoples across the world would recycle organic matter as fuel, while inorganic refuse would be used to build the foundations of a house. Precious metals, he said, would be melted down and re-shaped for a variety of tools. ""It's only when you get to the modern period of consumerism that you get this culture of obsolescence,"" he said. Dr. Jose Remesal Rodriguez is a professor of Ancient History at the University of Barcelona and an expert in the social and economic history of the Roman Empire, with a special interest in the production and trade of food in the ancient world.He is the director of excavations at an ancient dump site in Rome called Monte Testaccio. An artificial hill composed of more than 25 million discarded Roman amphorae -- or vase-shaped containers -- it tells us much about the ancient Roman trade in olive oil, which these amphorae were used to transport. ""A dump can be a particularly interesting source (for finding out) about the daily life (and) development of the civilization that created it,"" said Remesal. From the shards found at Monte Testaccio, he said, archaeologists were able to trace the evolution of food policy in the Roman Empire. ""Testaccio is a very special dump, which gives us information about a concrete product -- olive oil -- and the relations between the capital of the Empire and one of its provinces,"" Remesal explained. This prizing of ancient trash may seem at odds with our attitudes to waste today. But according to Meadow, scientists are already at work studying our trash and what it says about us. He cites as an example American archaeologist William Rathje, director of the ""Garbage Project"" in Arizona, which has sifted through and studied garbage from 1973 to the present day.  ""Some amazing statistics have come out of this -- how much food gets thrown out in the trash that was probably OK to eat, and other things hardly used that were thrown away,"" said Meadow.""It's an incredible array of material,"" he concluded.

(CNN)On Wednesday, the US Supreme Court will hear arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case involving a 2018 law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. If the justices side with the state of Mississippi, they effectively will be nullifying the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision -- significantly limiting women's reproductive rights.Though no one can predict how the justices will rule, the fact that they have agreed to hear this case is alarming.

She also teaches journalism to graduate students in the sciences at Columbia University. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)On Wednesday, the US Supreme Court will hear arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case involving a 2018 law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. If the justices side with the state of Mississippi, they effectively will be nullifying the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision -- significantly limiting women's reproductive rights.Though no one can predict how the justices will rule, the fact that they have agreed to hear this case is alarming. It is rare for the high court to reconsider the constitutionality of previously decided law. Even when the Supreme Court has heard challenges to Roe in the past, it has always left the basic constitutionality of abortion rights alone.JUST WATCHEDSCOTUS asks if Texas law would be a slippery slope for other rightsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSCOTUS asks if Texas law would be a slippery slope for other rights 03:27And yet, despite their record of affirmation, I am scared. I am of an age where I can remember what life was like for women in the years before Roe.  To be of childbearing age in the 1960s, as my friends and I were, meant knowing that our bodies and our futures didn't belong to us. Whatever we hoped to do with our lives could be compromised by the capriciousness of nature or by a thoughtless mistake or a contraceptive mishap.   Young people, then and now, are sexual beings. But before Roe, it was females who paid the biggest price for sexual expression. In my circle back then, I knew of women who'd had terrifying back-alley abortions, sometimes without anesthesia. After one friend had an illegal abortion, she developed a pelvic infection and was rendered sterile.

In my second year at college, I became pregnant. This was a decade before legalization. At first, I tried to self-abort with various home remedies. None worked.

Walter Lübcke, who was president of the Kassel regional council in central Germany, was shot in the head at close range on the terrace of his home in the small village of Istha, in the early hours of June 2.Sixty-five-year-old Lübcke was a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democrats and an outspoken supporter of the government's pro-migrant policies in the wake of the 2015 refugee crisis. The 45-year-old suspect was arrested on Saturday in Kassel based on traces of DNA evidence from the crime scene, according to the Hesse state office of criminal investigation and Kassel's public prosecutor.  The suspect has a long criminal record, police said.The past life and the ""openly expressed opinions and public views"" of the suspect linked him with the far right, Michael Schmidt, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office, told a news conference Monday.

Pro-migrant policies attract death threats and attacksAccording to police, Lübcke previously received death threats after a YouTube video emerged of him defending the country's immigration policies at a public meeting in Kassel in October 2015. The meeting was also attended by members of Pegida, a far-right anti-Islam movement.In the video, Lübcke says: ''You have to stand up for your values.

Interior minister Horst Seehofer also told the daily newspaper Tagesspiegel that ""if someone is so hated, just because he had liberal views, that is the decline of human morality.""The killing of Lübcke is not the first attack on a pro-migrant German politician in recent years. In 2016 a man -- referred to as Frank S. -- who also reportedly opposed Germany's open-door refugee policies was sentenced to 14 years in prison for stabbing Cologne mayoral candidate Henriette Reker, according to the New York Times.Another German politician well-known for his pro-refugee policies, Altena town mayor Andreas Hollstein, was stabbed in the neck at a kebab shop in 2017 by an assailant who reportedly said: ""You are leaving me die of thirst while you bring 200 refugees to Altena.""

The 45-year-old suspect was arrested on Saturday in Kassel based on traces of DNA evidence from the crime scene, according to the Hesse state office of criminal investigation and Kassel's public prosecutor.

Pro-migrant policies attract death threats and attacksAccording to police, Lübcke previously received death threats after a YouTube video emerged of him defending the country's immigration policies at a public meeting in Kassel in October 2015. The meeting was also attended by members of Pegida, a far-right anti-Islam movement.In the video, Lübcke says: ''You have to stand up for your values. If you don't share those values, then anyone is free to leave this country if they don't agree."" Some members of the crowd could be heard shouting ""get out, get out"" in response. German nurse who killed at least 85 patients jailed for lifeGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier condemned hate posts toward the pro-migrant politician. ''The way some individuals on social media are attacking his death, taking satisfaction from it and applauding it is cynical, tasteless, revolting and offensive in every way,"" he said in comments at a German town association event. Interior minister Horst Seehofer also told the daily newspaper Tagesspiegel that ""if someone is so hated, just because he had liberal views, that is the decline of human morality.""The killing of Lübcke is not the first attack on a pro-migrant German politician in recent years. In 2016 a man -- referred to as Frank S. -- who also reportedly opposed Germany's open-door refugee policies was sentenced to 14 years in prison for stabbing Cologne mayoral candidate Henriette Reker, according to the New York Times.Another German politician well-known for his pro-refugee policies, Altena town mayor Andreas Hollstein, was stabbed in the neck at a kebab shop in 2017 by an assailant who reportedly said: ""You are leaving me die of thirst while you bring 200 refugees to Altena.""

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Story highlightsSimone Biles leads the U.S. women's gymnastics team to RioBiles hasn't lost an all-around competition in three yearsShe could win five of the six gold medals available in women's gymnastics (CNN)The women's gymnastics U.S. Olympic Team Trials had concluded, and there was no suspense for Simone Biles on that July weekend.Biles did what she needed to do -- which is what she seemingly always does -- finishing first in the all-around competition. That top spot guaranteed the 4-foot-9-inch 19-year-old an automatic berth on the Olympic team.As Biles sat tight in the waiting room at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, with the other gymnasts, teammate Aly Raisman told her that it was OK to cry because she had already punched her ticket to Rio. But Biles wasn't ready to relax just yet. Not until the coordinator for the U.S. women's gymnastics national team, Martha Karolyi, made it official.""I was like, 'I'm not going to celebrate or take anything for granted until (Karolyi) comes in here and announces it,'"" Biles said.#Rio2016 pic.twitter.com/rcirDkcXrW— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) August 3, 2016But, really, Biles had all but clinched a spot on the team ages ago, and she's expected to dominate in Rio. Biles hasn't lost an all-around competition (the combined score in all four events -- vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise) in three years. She is a three-time world champion in the all-around and a four-time U.S. all-around champion. Biles has won 14 world medals (10 gold, two silver, two bronze), the most for a U.S. female gymnast.Read MoreAnd she gets high praise from another gymnastics icon: Mary Lou Retton, who was the first American to win all-around gold at the Olympics in 1984.""Just when we thought we were at the physical limit of the sport, then here comes Simone Biles,"" Retton said at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials. ""She's the best I've ever seen.""But if it wasn't for her maternal grandparents, Biles may not be in the Olympics at all.A life-changing moveAccording to Bleacher Report, Biles' father had abandoned the family, and Biles' biological mother struggled with drug and alcohol abuse. A young Simone and her sister, Adria, ended up in foster care in Ohio.Then her grandparents, Ron and Nellie Biles, stepped in, eventually bringing Biles and Adria to Spring, Texas, in 2002 and adopting them. Two older Biles children moved in with Ron Biles' sister in Ohio.After the adoption was official, Nellie Biles said to the girls, ""It's up to you guys, but you can call us mom and dad if you want.""The next day Simone asked, ""Grandma, can I call you Mom?""""Of course,"" Nellie said.Simone now had a mom and dad. What followed was the blossoming of a gymnastics prodigy.In 2003, a 6-year-old Biles was on a daycare field trip at a gym and was seen imitating other gymnasts. The gym sent home a letter to Biles' family requesting she join tumbling or gymnastics.It was a good recommendation. Today, Biles is the best in the world. Her skill power is unmatched. She even has a move on her favorite event, floor, named after her. The ""Biles"" is a tumbling pass that has a double layout -- which has been in gymnastics for decades -- but she takes it up another level by adding a half twist at the end, making it a blind landing.Simone Biles could win five of six medals available in the Rio Olympics, including on the balance beam.""I've seen everyone so shocked whenever I do that skill because it's a forward landing,"" Biles said. ""So it's harder, and to do a half twist is hard also. So, nobody thought it was possible, and so every time I do it everyone just gets so excited.""Raisman said that sometimes she thinks Biles isn't human because of what she can do. ""I'm always in awe when I watch her,"" Raisman said. ""But I have a lot of respect for her because normally when girls are super, super talented... they don't work that hard, but she is super talented, and she works very hard, which is why she has been unbeatable.""When Raisman found out she made her second Olympic team, she started crying. That struck a chord with Biles.""Yeah, I'm not really a crier, but Aly started crying, and it just made me really emotional because she's gone through it,"" Biles said, ""So it was just kind of exciting for her and for all of us in that we were actually finally done.""But while Biles' place in gymnastics history is already assured, she really isn't finished. Not by a long shot.One item missing from her gymnastics resuméThe only hardware missing for Biles -- who wasn't eligible to compete in the 2012 Olympics in London because of her age -- is an Olympic medal. Theoretically, that shouldn't be an issue, as she has a good shot to win five of the six golds available in Rio. The US -- led by Biles -- is the favorite to win team gold. Biles is the clear favorite in the all-around. She's also in the running to win individual events in vault, beam and floor.And if it wasn't scary enough for her competition, there is no lack of motivation for Biles, as she isn't entering Rio on a high note -- by her standards, anyway. On the second day of the U.S. Olympic Team Trials, which was her last competition before Rio, Biles wasn't as sharp as usual. She had some uncharacteristic errors, including a fall on the beam.• podium training • pic.twitter.com/qqp1SENkDn— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) August 5, 2016Consider it more fuel to her competitive fire.""I don't really view myself as the world's best or anything like that,"" Biles said in the spring, according to Bleacher Report. ""I have great confidence in what I do, and I'm really just competing against myself out there. I know my whole career is building toward the Olympics, and it can sound like a lot of pressure, but I'm just staying focused on what I can control and do my thing. I'm not alone; my family is with me when I'm out there competing. And I do believe in myself. I really do.""Follow Jill Martin on Twitter  Question: Who told her to cry?"

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article: Story highlightsAndy Spyra took portraits of women who had been abducted by Boko Haram in NigeriaDozens would sit in front of the camera and tell their personal stories of survival (CNN)Nearly two years have passed since the terror group Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls in Chibok, Nigeria, unleashing a global outcry to bring them back.But according to photojournalist Andy Spyra, ""the Chibok girls (are) just the tip of the iceberg; what happened there is what happens on a nearly daily basis.""Spyra has been documenting the return of abducted women in Nigeria, their dangerous journeys and their difficult reintroduction to society. In July, he traveled to Yola, the capital of the northeastern state of Adamawa and the front lines of the government's war against Boko Haram. There, he and reporter Wolfgang Bauer talked with women who had survived the brutality and torture of the Islamic militant group.""I was moved by the strength of the women ... you would sometimes just listen to their stories and be overwhelmed by it, what they would tell you,"" Spyra said. Photographer Andy SpyraWhen their story was published in Zeit, a German magazine, the journalists also included a call for help: Please help us create a fund to help these women.Read More""I had this wish to come back and help them in a real concrete way, to come back with something physical in my hands to give back to them,"" Spyra said. His wish was granted. The response ""got pretty big,"" Spyra said, and in January they went back to help these women set up bank accounts.Spyra soon found himself on the phone more than behind the camera. Delivering money to these women who live in one of the world's most dangerous areas seemed quixotic at first. But it worked.""It was all teamwork,"" Spyra said. ""I had a local fixer in Yola who helped identify former Boko Haram victims. The security was tricky even for him. It took some time, at least six months, until he gave us a list of 72 women near the Sambisa Forest.""Social mediaFollow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.The women were put on a bus, and every detail was taken care of to avoid attention from potential suicide bombers. The women were even patted down and walked through a metal detector. ""It was such a sensitive issue for these women,"" Spyra said. ""They had never seen a white man before, and what a cultural gap there was. And at the same time I felt connected to them on a human level, an emotional level."" But before organizing their finances, Spyra wanted to immortalize their stories through what he knew how to do best. Photographing them this time, however, would be tricky for security reasons. He had to shield them from potential eavesdroppers and avoid attracting attention. With a piece of black cloth, a few rags and a little chair, Spyra created a makeshift studio at a church compound. There, one by one, dozens of women would sit in front of the camera and tell their personal stories of survival.There were snakes and scorpions, rivers that you had to cross where thousands of women have died in their attempt to flee. These women are really strong and really tough, and how they did it, I don't know.Photographer Andy Spyra""We heard stories of dead bodies and mass graves, the others in the forest of people who didn't make it,"" Spyra said. ""There were snakes and scorpions, rivers that you had to cross where thousands of women have died in their attempt to flee. These women are really strong and really tough, and how they did it, I don't know.""Spyra said ""in some cases, they escaped during bombardment of Boko Haram-held villages. Some of them scaled fences. Some of them had smart ideas about saying they were going to the market, and they just ran off.""The resulting photo series is an ode to the victims, their forgotten odysseys, their loss of childhood and the difficult road ahead. Partially lit in natural light and enveloped by a heavy black background like a penumbra, their faces -- especially their eyes -- reflect something they are holding very deep. The economy of lighting emphasizes the scars, the gaze and the discreet expressions of the humanity that has survived so much pain. It is the art of portraiture, something Spyra confessed he knew nothing about.""I was sweating like hell, not because of the heat in Nigeria, but because I was nervous because I had never had a portrait assignment,"" he said. ""This was my first attempt.""This is how I could best convey their characters and their personalities. They were radiating, they were strong personalities. I was impressed by their presence after all they had been through, so strong and confident. It really was powerful.""Andy Spyra is a photographer based in Germany. You can follow him on Facebook.

"Use the following article to answer the question: Article:  (CNN)The UK's postal service is urging environmental campaigners to stop sending empty potato chip bags without an envelope after the launch of a campaign urging the country's most popular chip producer to ditch its plastic packaging.The online campaign, which has been signed by more than 310,000 people, calls on the PepsiCo-owned British chip manufacturer Walkers to make its plastic packaging more environmentally friendly. Campaigners have been posting pictures of themselves mailing their empty bags of chips, or crisps as they are known in the UK, through the Royal Mail with the hashtag #PacketInWalkers.The UK consumes approximately 6 billion packets of potato chips every year, according to campaign organizer Geraint Ashcroft. Most of those bags are not recyclable.""That's an awful lot of landfill and poison for the environment,"" Ashcroft wrote on the campaign's petition page.Read MoreWalkers, which produces 11 million bags of potato chips daily, has said that it plans to make its packaging plastic-free by 2025.In a statement emailed to CNN on Wednesday, a Walkers spokesperson said: ""We have received some returned packets and recognize the efforts being made to bring the issue of packaging waste to our attention. The returned packets will be used in our research, as we work towards our commitment of improving the recyclability of our packaging."" The spokesperson added that PepsiCo is working on a number of ways to tackle the issue, including a pilot of compostable packaging in the US, India and Chile. But some campaigners say those proposals aren't enough.  Campaigner Jarred Livesey wrote on Twitter: ""2025 is too long to wait for you to use plastic free packaging. It's just not good enough. You produce 4 billion packs per year. I'm sending these back to you so you can deal with your own waste. #PacketInWalkers."" .@walkers_crisps 2025 is too long to wait for you to use plastic free packaging. It's just not good enough.

Trump said the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine would be available by prescription to treat the novel coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the two drugs would be made available but there needs to be way to see how safe they are and whether they work to inhibit coronavirus.""What the President was saying is that we're going to look at all of these drugs and we're going to try to get them available in the context of some sort of protocol,"" he said, referring to a trial period, on CNN's ""Coronavirus: Fact and Fears"" town hall special.The doctor wanted to make sure Americans know there are no proven safe and effective therapies as of today.""That doesn't mean that we're not going to do everything we can to make things that have even a hint of efficacy more readily available,"" Fauci told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

The administration faced criticism in recent days for being unable to say exactly how many people in the US had been tested. ""Testing is available in all 50 states,"" the vice president said. ""It is becoming increasingly available literally every hour of the day."" Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said the ""dramatic increases in the number of new cases"" was ""based on our ability to test additional people."" The number of cases will continue to rise over the next two or three days, she said, as health officials clear testing backlogs. ""The number of test positives are increasing,"" Birx said. ""That is a dramatically important signature that everyone is doing their job."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN in an interview Thursday morning that 8,000 tests were done in his state overnight. Later in the evening, officials reported New York state had 5,298 coronavirus cases -- an increase of about 2,300 since late Wednesday. ""When you do 8,000 tests,"" the governor said, ""the numbers are going to go up exponentially."" More than 2,700 new cases were reported in the US in 24 hours between Wednesday morning and Thursday morning. At least 13,133 people across the country have tested positive for the virus, as of Thursday evening. At least 193 have died. But as the number of cases grows, so does the burden on health officials across the country.

He said Thursday that the city needs 3 million N95 masks, 50 million surgical masks and 15,000 ventilators. Additionally, the city needs 25 million surgical gowns, coveralls, gloves and face masks.Officials in King County, Washington, on Wednesday said they are setting up a temporary hospital on a soccer field that will provide the county an additional 200 medical beds. Health officials estimated the county needs about 3,000 more beds.Health officials in Washington state said they would be setting up medical beds in a soccer field.Meanwhile, Maryland health officials were working to increase their number of beds by at least 6,000, and in New York state, Gov.

A further 86 are suspected of such activity, according to the figures, compiled by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence,.President Obama campaigned fervently to close down Guantanamo Bay before his election in 2009 but, faced by opposition in Congress,  failed to do so over his eight-year leadership, though he reduced the number of detainees to 55 by the end of his second term in office.

About 81% of Malawi's population is Christian, according to a 2014 national survey.In the three years that have passed since the draft bill was first introduced thousands more women have resorted to risky clandestine abortions -- 141,000 in 2015 alone, according to the Guttmacher report.Minyatso says he was devastated when he heard that Selina was dead.

I want government authorities to know the gravity of harm that restrictive abortion laws have caused to women,"" Kawala said.Still, parliamentarians are noncommittal about their position on the draft bill, and refer to their religion when discussing its merits.Aisha Mambo of Mangochi-Nkungulu Constituency said she wouldn't comment until she had scrutinized the final bill: ""And I will base my position on what my religion says about abortion because I can't act against the teachings of my religion.""       Back in Malawi's largest referral health facility, Mhango says the issue has nothing to do with religion.""The debate is not about whether abortion is good or not,"" Mhango said, adding that the law needs to change if it can't be properly enforced.
