        "context": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump tried to end the special counsel probe in December, marking the second known attempt to do so, The New York Times reported Tuesday. \n \n The Times report on Tuesday evening came as CNN reported that Trump is considering firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who has oversight of the Mueller probe, following a federal raid on Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen. \n \n In December, angered by reports of subpoenas for information on his business with Deutsche Bank, Trump told advisers he wanted the investigation to be shut down, according to the Times' report. \n \n The Times report, based on interviews with eight sources, said the President backed down after Mueller's office told Trump's lawyers and advisers that reports about the subpoenas were inaccurate. \n \n The report outlines the second time Trump is known to have moved to quash the probe, and follows previous reporting that the President moved to fire Mueller last June, which a source said White House counsel Donald McGahn refused. Trump denied the story at the time. \n \n Read More ||||| Over the next couple of days, Mr. Trump pestered Mr. McGahn about the firing, but Mr. McGahn would not tell Mr. Rosenstein. The badgering by the president got so bad that Mr. McGahn wrote a resignation letter and was prepared to quit. It was only after Mr. McGahn made it known to senior White House officials that he was going to resign that Mr. Trump backed down. \n \n The articles that provoked Mr. Trump\u2019s anger in December \u2014 which were published by Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters \u2014 said one of Mr. Mueller\u2019s subpoenas had targeted Mr. Trump\u2019s and his family\u2019s banking records at Deutsche Bank. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, who have studied Mr. Trump\u2019s bank accounts, did not believe the articles were accurate because Mr. Trump did not have his money there. \n \n The lawyers were also able to learn that federal prosecutors in a different inquiry had issued a subpoena for entities connected to the family business of Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The news outlets later clarified the articles, saying that the subpoena to Deutsche Bank pertained to people affiliated with Mr. Trump, who was satisfied with the explanation and dropped his push to fire Mr. Mueller. \n \n The White House did not respond to an email seeking comment. \n \n Acutely conscious of the threat Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation poses, Mr. Trump has openly discussed ways to shut it down. Each time, he has been convinced by his lawyers and advisers that taking the step would only exacerbate his problems. In some cases, they have explained to Mr. Trump how anything that causes him to lose support from congressional Republicans could further imperil his presidency. \n \n But Mr. Trump\u2019s statements to his advisers have been significant enough to attract attention from Mr. Mueller himself. Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have interviewed current and former White House officials and have requested documents to understand whether these efforts show evidence the president is trying to obstruct the Justice Department\u2019s investigation, according to two people briefed on the matter. \n \n Mr. Trump\u2019s frustrations have tended to flare up in response to developments in the news, especially accounts of appearances of witnesses, whom Mr. Trump feels were unfairly and aggressively approached by investigators. They include his former communications director, Hope Hicks, and his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. \n \n The venting has usually been dismissed by his advisers, many of whom insist they have come to see the statements less as direct orders than as simply how the president talks, and that he often does not follow up on his outbursts. \n \n One former adviser said that people had become conditioned to wait until Mr. Trump had raised an issue at least three times before acting on it. The president\u2019s diatribes about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Mr. Rosenstein and the existence of the special counsel have, for most of the White House aides, become a dependable part of the fabric of life working for this president. ||||| President Trump Donald John TrumpStone: 'I\u2019ve never had any discussion' with Trump about a pardon White House: Trump will move forward on wall 'with or without' Dems Pelosi after Stone indictment: 'What does Putin have on the president'?

The comments suggest the White House may be looking for legal arguments to back a decision to fire Mueller. \n \n Legal experts say Trump does not have the power to fire Mueller directly. Under Justice Department regulations, that authority falls to the agency official in charge of the investigation \u2014 in this case Rosenstein. \n \n It is easy to see why a Trump decision to fire Mueller would make Republicans queasy. \n \n A Quinnipiac University poll conducted this month found that 69 percent of American voters oppose Trump firing Mueller while only 13 percent support it. More than half of the Republicans polled, 55 percent, said Trump shouldn\u2019t interfere. \n \n Republicans are worried about a wave election this fall that could cost them their House majority. There are also fears about the Senate, though the fact that Democrats are defending many more seats in the upper chamber gives Republicans more confidence about holding it. \n \n Still, many GOP senators fear firing Mueller would pose new risks to their majority. \n \n Trump also has reason to fear a Democratic takeover of the House and Senate, which would unleash investigations of his administration. \n \n Amid uncertainty over what Trump will do next, some Republicans are pushing for legislation to protect Mueller, although that path doesn\u2019t yet have much support in the party. \n \n Sens.

READ NOW ||||| Few reptiles can breathe underwater. Australia is home to one of the exceptions, the white-throated snapping turtle (Elseya albagula), which can extract oxygen from water through its backside via a process called cloacal respiration. This unusual technique, shared by a handful of other turtle and fish species, gave the turtles an evolutionary advantage for millennia, allowing them to hide from predators underwater for days at a time. \n \n Unfortunately, breathing out of your butt requires very specific conditions that no longer exist in the turtles' only habitat, Queensland's Connors River and three nearby catchments. Dams, weirs, agriculture and mining have left the water sluggish and full of sediment. That makes it significantly harder for the turtles\u2014especially vulnerable juveniles\u2014to stay underwater. As a result, predation has increased to the point where populations have crashed. The problem has gotten so bad that less than 1 percent of eggs and young turtles survive to adulthood and the species has now been declared critically endangered by the Australian government \n \n Connors River itself is the healthiest ecosystem in the region with relatively clearer waters and a good rate of water flow\u2014but that may not stay that way forever. Four years ago, when James Cook University researcher Jason Schaffer started studying turtles there, he considered the river to be what he calls \"a doomed landscape.\" A planned dam threatened to destroy the bum-breathing turtle's only safe habitat. \n \n Schaffer says working in the region \"was very hard mentally\" because of the dam project. \"I worked quite closely with a few landowners who had their properties forcibly acquired by the government and were distressed about the whole situation.\" Luckily, financing fell through for the project but the potential that it could be resurrected looms over the region. \"All the planning has been done and the land has only been leased back to the property owners,\" he says. \"There is a risk that the dam will still go ahead in the future if it again becomes financially viable, and that worries me a bit.\" \n \n The turtles' critically endangered designation might influence any future efforts to build the dam but many other threats remain. Invasive species such as cats, dogs and foxes, which eat eggs and young turtles, pose one of the greatest risks. The turtles' eggs are particularly vulnerable. Schaffer says the turtles lay their eggs in July but they take about seven months to hatch because they go through a semi-dormant phase called diapause until the summer rainy season begins. \"This makes them more vulnerable to predation than a lot of other turtle species,\" he says. In addition, the nests all too often get trampled by the cattle on the agricultural land that surrounds the rivers. \n \n Man-made construction also poses a threat for the few remaining adults. Dams and weirs effectively trap them in certain locations, preventing turtles from traveling to find mates. Shaffer reports that many turtles try to overcome these obstacles but end up falling when they attempt to cross the weirs; their shells crack or shatter and the animals die. \n \n If they survive, white-throated snapping turtles have very long life spans, perhaps as much as 100 years, but that also works against them. For one thing, the species typically starts breeding at 20 years of age. For another, Schaffer fears their long lives create the perception that they can survive if dams are built and more water is taken from the rivers for use by industry. \"What [people] don't realize,\" he says, \"is that almost nothing is surviving. When these aged adults eventually die there is nothing coming up to replace them. Pretty soon we'll blink and there will be no more left\u2014just like that.\" \n \n Schaffer plans to keep studying the turtles and seeks funding to survey additional populations. He hopes to learn more about their susceptibility to environmental threats. Understanding the consequences of habitat alteration could help to predict the threats that these turtles and other species could face in the future. \n \n There's one more important reason to study the species, he adds: \"These turtles breathe out of their ass, which is super awesome.\" \n \n Photo: Stephen Zozaya, courtesy of James Cook University",

Once they have located the target, snipers follow the same methodical approach before each shot.

It is not just a sniper. They work in pairs. There is an observer,\" a military source said. \"This is a skill set that only a very few people have.\" \n \n The skill of the JTF2 sniper in taking down an insurgent at 3,540 metres required math skills, great eyesight, precision of ammunition and firearms, and superb training. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n \"It is at the distance where you have to account not just for the ballistics of the round, which change over time and distance, you have to adjust for wind, and the wind would be swirling,\" said a source with expertise in training Canadian special forces. \n \n \"You have to adjust for him firing from a higher location downward and as the round drops you have to account for that. And from that distance you actually have to account for the curvature of the Earth.\" \n \n U.S. Sergeant Bryan Kremer has the longest confirmed sniper kill shot by a U.S. soldier.

        "context": "Fleetwood Mac, which has sold more than 100 million records, is announcing a new tour today that kicks off in October. But lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham won't be on it. \n \n In its more than 50 years as a band, Fleetwood Mac has become famous for its dysfunction and turmoil. But the announcement this month that Buckingham was ousted from the band still came as a shock. For the first time, band members tell CBS News what happened. \n \n This week the new lineup was still getting to know each other, reports CBS News correspondent Anthony Mason. \n \n The first photo session for the new Fleetwood Mac included Mike Campbell, former lead guitarist for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn, frontman for Crowded House. New members, but hardly novices. \n \n \"Both these gentlemen have a legacy of their own. They don't need to have a calling card. They are who they are in their own right,\" drummer Mick Fleetwood said. \n \n With them, Fleetwood said, Fleetwood Mac has been reborn. \n \n \"So it's effectively a new band?\" Mason said. \n \n \"This is absolutely a new band,\" Fleetwood responded. \"This is the new lineup of Fleetwood Mac.\" \n \n The new lineup of Fleetwood Mac CBS News \n \n Neither Campbell or Finn are thinking of this as a temporary gig. \n \n \"I'm making this my priority until whenever, you know. We'll see what happens,\" Campbell said. \n \n They will replace Buckingham, who joined the group back in 1974, helped re-shape their sound and wrote some of the group's biggest hits. \n \n \"Mick, when did you decide that you had to make this change?\" Mason asked. \n \n \"It happened after we played in New York at the MusiCares event, which you were there,\" Fleetwood said. \n \n It was the band's last performance in late January when they were honored at the MusiCares benefit on Grammy weekend. All five members of the classic lineup appeared together. But tensions were building, Fleetwood said, because Buckingham would not sign off on a new tour they'd been planning for a year and a half. \n \n Honorees Stevie Nicks, John McVie, Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Mick Fleetwood perform onstage during MusiCares Person of the Year honoring Fleetwood Mac at Radio City Music Hall on January 26, 2018 in New York City. Dia Dipasupil / Getty Images \n \n \"It became just a huge impasse and hit a brick wall, where we decided that we had to part company,\" Fleetwood said. \n \n \"Was Lindsey effectively fired?\" Mason asked. \n \n \"Well, we don't use that word because I think it's ugly. And it's not a question that Lindsey has huge amounts of respect and kudos to what he's done within the ranks of Fleetwood Mac and always will,\" Fleetwood said. \"But it's like a marriage that came to an end and there are reasons why. \u2026 But as a band we needed to move on and we have and that's --\" \n \n \"Because people who saw you in New York would've thought everything was OK. But it wasn't?\" Mason asked. \n \n \"No, it was not,\" Fleetwood said. \n \n Stevie Nicks supported the decision to part ways. \n \n \"This team wanted to get out on the road. And one of the members did not want to get out on the road for a year,\" Nicks said. \"We just couldn't agree. And you know, when you're in a band, it's a team. I mean I have a solo career, and I love my solo career, and I'm the boss. Absolutely. But I'm not the boss in this band.\" \n \n So just six days after the MusiCares performance, Campbell got a phone call from Fleetwood. \"It was my birthday. And I was sitting in my backyard,\" Campbell recounted. He said he was wondering what he was going to do. He had a few things in the works, \"but nothing quite as big as this,\" he said with a laugh. \n \n Campbell was in as lead guitarist. But the band still needed another singer. \n \n \"We sat around a table and we just started listening to everybody we could think of,\" Nicks said. \"Anywhere between, you know, 27 and 65. It was like -- it was crazy!\" \n \n \"I just made it,\" Finn joked. \n \n Finn, who turns 60 next month, was in his hometown, Auckland, New Zealand, when he got the call. \n \n \"I just had this kind of big grin on my face 'cause it's a call you never expect to get,\" Finn said. \n \n They all met up at a theater in Maui on March 21. Nicks said they played together for two days. \n \n \"And it did sound really good and I have film to prove it,\" Nicks said. \n \n We saw the cellphone footage of that first session. They ran through 10 songs in those two days. Christine McVie also liked what she heard. \n \n \"The essence of the band was great, and fun, and the three voices sound really good together,\" McVie said. \"I'm really happy.\" \n \n \"It already feels like a band when we've only played once or twice. But with a little rehearsal, I think it's just gonna be incredible,\" Campbell said. \n \n For him, it's a new beginning after losing Tom Petty last fall. \n \n \"It changed me and Mike for sure, in that you know, we need to take everyday that we have until we're gone and make it the best day we can because if that could happen to Tom, then it could happen to anybody,\" Nicks said. \"And I'm gonna have the most fun I can and I'm gonna stop complaining. And I'm gonna throw myself into all these projects because you just never know.\" \n \n Nicks, Campbell and Petty go way back. They co-wrote her first solo hit, \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around.\" \n \n If all goes well, the band says they hope to record. They also said they did audition one other singer in Maui, but they won't reveal who that was. ||||| A little over a month ago, the majority of Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood \u2013 quietly gathered at a little theater in Maui with their future in doubt. The band had secretly parted ways with Lindsey Buckingham, the longtime guitarist and voice behind many of their most enduring songs. According to the group, the split came down to a scheduling conflict surrounding a world tour. \u201cWe were supposed to go into rehearsal in June and he wanted to put it off until November [2019],\u201d says Nicks. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time. I just did 70 shows [on a solo tour]. As soon as I finish one thing, I dive back into another. Why would we stop? We don\u2019t want to stop playing music. We don\u2019t have anything else to do. This is what we do.\u201d \n \n \n \n Related Broken Chain: A History of Fleetwood Mac Firings and Departures Lindsey Buckingham's firing is just the latest in a decades-long game of musical chairs for the Hall of Fame band \n \n So instead, they invited Mike Campbell, the former guitarist of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Crowded House frontman Neil Finn and spent a few days workshopping tunes from their vast catalog to see if this new lineup had the right chemistry. \u201cI immediately felt like I\u2019d known them for years,\u201d says Christine McVie, \u201ceven though we\u2019d only just met.\u201d \n \n The new lineup will embark on a massive 52-date tour beginning October 3rd in Tulsa and criss-crossing the country before wrapping up in Phladelphia in April 2019. Tickets for the tour go on sale Friday, May 4th at 10 a.m. local time. (A complete itinerary is listed below.) The group also announced the launch of a SiriusXM channel devoted to the band beginning Tuesday, May 1st. \n \n Nobody in the group is quite willing to say Buckingham was \u201cfired,\u201d but they don\u2019t completely object to the term. \u201cWords like \u2018fired\u2019 are ugly references as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d says Fleetwood. \u201cNot to hedge around, but we arrived at the impasse of hitting a brick wall. This was not a happy situation for us in terms of the logistics of a functioning band. To that purpose, we made a decision that we could not go on with him. Majority rules in term of what we need to do as a band and go forward.\u201d Buckingham did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. \n \n \n \n \"Majority rules in term of what we need to do as a band and go forward\" - Mick Fleetwood \n \n Buckingham\u2019s ousting marks the latest messy chapter in the ongoing 50-year Fleetwood Mac story \u2013 or, as drummer Mick Fleetwood tells it, business as usual. When key early members like Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer left the group in the early 1970s, Fleetwood got right on the phone and recruited new ones. The group never stopped working, even when Nicks left in the early 1990s and a new lineup found themselves opening up for the likes of REO Speedwagon on the state fair circuit. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that my instincts, for better or worse, have always been to gravitate towards going forward,\u201d Fleetwood tells Rolling Stone. \u201cHaving said that, I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t literally say to myself, \u2018This one needs a lot of thought.\u2019\u201d \n \n \n \n One of the first people that came to mind was Campbell, who was at his home on the Hawaiian island of Kauai when the call came. It happened to be his 68th birthday. \u201cI was sitting in my yard by my pool contemplating my future without my partner [Tom Petty], which was going to be a dark place in a lot of ways,\u201d he says. \u201c I said, \u2018Give me a day to think it over.\u2019 The more I thought about it, the more I though it could be great. I\u2019ve known Stevie for years and we\u2019ve always been very creative together.\u201d \n \n Related Rob Sheffield on Why the Latest Fleetwood Mac Breakup Is Peak Mac The band's firing of Lindsey Buckingham might be the most quintessential chapter yet in the band's epic saga of dysfunction \n \n Not long after getting a commitment from Campbell, Fleetwood called up Finn at his New Zealand home. The singer had enormous success in the 1970s and 1980s with his bands Split Enz and Crowded House, but he was now earning a comfortable living as a solo artist with a devoted cult following. Getting back in the arena rock game was the last thing on his mind. \u201cI was stunned when I got the call from Mick,\u201d he says. \u201cI was enjoying my life and my music, but I have a restless nature and now I\u2019m relishing this beautiful gift that\u2019s been given to me.\u201d \n \n The group has yet to begin formal rehearsals - which they say will last two months working five days a week - but they've already decided that this tour will feature songs from the entire history of Fleetwood Mac, not just the original Buckingham/Nicks run from 1975 to 1987. \u201cWe were never able to do that since 1975 because certain people in the band weren\u2019t interested in doing that,\u201d says Nicks. \u201cNow we\u2019re able to open the set with a lot; a raucous version of [1969\u2019s] \u2018Rattlesnake Shake\u2019 or something. I\u2019d also like to do [1970\u2019s] \u2018Station Man,\u2019 which has always been one of may favorites. We\u2019re definitely doing [1970\u2019s] \u2018Oh Well.\u2019\u201d \n \n \n \n How does this all feel to bassist John McVie, the guy that put the \u201cMac\u201d in Fleetwood Mac but speaks so infrequently that most fans don\u2019t even know what his voice sounds like? \u201cI felt very comfortable when we rehearsed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seemed to fit. It\u2019s another exciting chapter in the book, in the saga.\u201d \n \n The expanded set, however, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be neglecting the big radio hits like \u201cGold Dust Woman\u201d and \u201cThe Chain.\u201d \u201cThere are 10 hits we have to do,\u201d says Nicks. \u201cThat leaves another 13 songs if you want to do a three-hour show. Then you crochet them all together and you make a great sequence and you have something that nobody has seen before except all the things they want to see are there. At rehearsal, we\u2019re going to put up a board of 60 songs. Then we start with number one and we go through and we play everything. Slowly you start taking songs off and you start to see your set come together.\u201d \n \n \"This is sad for me, but I want the next 10 years of my life to be really fun and happy\" - Stevie Nicks \n \n The band realizes that a Fleetwood Mac tour without Buckingham will be a different experience, but they soldiered on without him on the 1987 Tango In The Night tour and didn\u2019t see a big decline in attendance. They also had 16 years of successful road work without Christine McVie when she left in 1998. She came back for the 2015 On With The Show tour, and last year recorded an album with Buckingham that they supported with a long tour that wrapped up just five months ago. \u201cI had a great time with him on the road and making that record,\u201d she says. \u201cI was surprised to hear the news because it happened after I went back to London that the decision was made. But life moves on and I wanted to carry on with these guys.\u201d \n \n \n \n For Nicks, carrying on without Buckingham is bittersweet. \u201cOur relationship has always been volatile,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were never married, but we might as well have been. Some couples get divorced after 40 years. They break their kids' hearts and destroy everyone around them because it\u2019s just hard. This is sad for me, but I want the next 10 years of my life to be really fun and happy. I want to get up every day and dance around my apartment and smile and say, \u2018Thank God for this amazing life.\u2019\u201d \n \n \n \n Fleetwood Mac North American Tour \n \n \n \n October 3 - Tulsa, OK @ BOK Center \n \n October 6 - Chicago, IL @ United Center \n \n October 10 - Louisville, KY @ KFC Yum!

A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds I\u2019m going to take that dog away from you. Not a fucking thing you can do about it either because you are a weak broke piece of shit I will prove to the world you\u2019re a liar \n \n \u201cYou don't have a constitutional right to threaten me and especially not threaten my dog\u2026 you crossed a red line,\u201d Credico retorted. Stone had threatened to steal his service dog. \n \n \u201cRot in hell,\u201d Stone replied. \n \n A month later, they had another semi-incomprehensible exchange that included accusations of drug abuse and financial problems. Stone emailed Credico, \u201cI will piss on your grave.\u201d \n \n A few weeks after that later, Stone and Credico had another dramatic exchange. \n \n \u201cYou are a pathetic loser,\u201d Stone wrote on May 21. \u201cLet\u2019s see who\u2019s around a year from now and who isn\u2019t cocksucker\u201d \n \n \u201cAnother one of your threats,\u201d Credico replied. \n \n \u201cNot a threat. A prediction. How you feeling champ ?\u201d Roger replied. \n \n The Daily Beast shared screenshots of the emails with Stone\u2019s lawyer, Grant Smith. When asked if he had any comment, Smith replied, \u201cNo.\u201d \n \n After publication, Smith said Mueller was misusing the emails. \n \n \u201cYou are presenting things that are completely out of context with a decades long relationship,\u201d he texted. \u201cThese two people talk like that to one another for years and years, it is nothing unusual and it certainly does not rise to the level of what the special counsel\u2019s office charged.\u201d \n \n Martin Stolar, a lawyer for Credico, declined to comment. \u201cRandy will make public statements concerning the indictment if and when he\u2019s called to testify.\u201d he said. \n \n Stone and Credico\u2019s relationship\u2014the link between a political arch-villain and a New York stand-up comic\u2014has found its way into the investigation of the century. And it highlights one of the most amusing realities of the special counsel's into Russian meddling in the 2016 election: Mueller, a notoriously serious and straight-faced law man, has spent a huge amount of time dealing with clowns. \n \n Stone, for his part, is basically a political performance artist. He spent his decades-long career in the public eye enmeshing himself in scandals, lobbing wild-eyed accusations at his critics, and honing the practice of wildly over-the-top political dirty tricks. He also wrote a column on men\u2019s fashion for The Daily Caller. \n \n He wore a top hat to Trump\u2019s inauguration. He paraded around the 2016 Republican National Convention alongside conspiracy-monger Alex Jones while sporting a T-shirt accusing Bill Clinton of rape. He suggested Trump fans should storm the hotel rooms of RNC delegates who didn\u2019t support Trump. He got booted from Twitter and banned from CNN. \n \n He ran a lobbying firm with Paul Manafort. He got fired from Bob Dole\u2019s campaign for putting out a newspaper ad for swingers. He starred in a Netflix documentary. He left the Trump campaign under contested circumstances and endeared himself to the internet conspiracy community, even questioning the scientific consensus on vaccines. \n \n This is the man Mueller has dogged for months. \n \n Credico, whose communications with Stone featured in his indictment, is also an ur-eccentric. As a comedian and drug-legalization activist, he drew notoriety for marching into the New York State Capitol dressed as the ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes, complete with a toga and a fake beard. Once there, he protested the state\u2019s drug laws by lighting up a joint. \n \n Credico is an expert at mimicking other people\u2019s voices, impersonating Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump at the drop of a hat. A small, white long-haired dog named Bianca is his constant companion. He even took her along for questioning by Mueller\u2019s team. \n \n Both men drew Mueller\u2019s interest\u2014Credico as a witness, Stone as a target\u2014because of their shared interest in WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Credico, a self-described lefty, has long been a fan of WikiLeaks for revealing government secrets. Stone, meanwhile, wanted to get to Assange during the 2016 campaign in the his site had emails Hillary Clinton hadn\u2019t made public. \n \n A few weeks before the election, Credico interviewed Assange on his radio show. He would later visit the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The two men exchanged emails about Wikileaks before Assange started dumping emails stolen from Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. And Stone also made a series of cryptic, apparently prescient, statements about Wikileaks, which generated noisy speculation that he was getting information from inside the embassy. \n \n After the election, when Special Counsel Mueller started investigating potential coordination between the Kremlin and Trumpworld, he soon zeroed in on Stone. As Mueller questioned a host of Stone\u2019s long-time associates, congressional investigators grilled Stone himself. \n \n Credico, in turn, faced questions about his relationships with WikiLeaks, ties to Stone, and alleged work as an intermediary between Stone and Assange. Stone had hinted in the past that Credico connected him to WikiLeaks, while Credico has long denied acting as any sort of go-between. \n \n As those probes unfolded, Stone grew increasingly agitated. He told reporters he expected to be charged, and he lambasted Mueller for running a witch hunt. A few days before his indictment, he texted The Daily Beast to say he would expose monstrous misconduct by Mueller\u2019s team if indicted. \n \n On Friday morning, it was clear Stone\u2019s actions after Mueller\u2019s probe started had created his most immediate legal problems. The indictment alleges that he lied to Congress about his communications with Credico and another associate, Jerome Corsi; that he obstructed an official proceeding; and that he tampered with an unnamed witness, known to be Credico. And it cites the email printed above as one example of a statement \u201cintended to prevent Person 2 from cooperating with the investigations.\u201d \n \n That\u2019s how a foul-mouthed exchange that reads like it's written on the wall of a dive-bar bathroom found its way into what\u2019s arguably the most geopolitically consequential criminal investigation in decades.",

        "context": "The Florida Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the state's death penalty was so flawed for so long that more than half of the people on death row may be entitled to new sentencing hearings. \n \n That opinion, handed down in a pair of decisions Thursday, covers more than 200 inmates awaiting execution \u2014 and includes all of those who were sentenced after 2002 or whose appeals were not final by that year. \n \n It is a legal decision that death row inmates, defense attorneys, prosecutors and the families of murder victims have awaited since January, when the U.S. Supreme Court found the state's death penalty unconstitutional. \n \n ID photos of Central Florida convicted killers on Florida death row. (Florida Department of Corrections) (Florida Department of Corrections) \n \n That ruling made it clear that Florida needed to rework its death penalty statute to bring it in line with other states that handled those cases, specifically by requiring that juries \u2014 not judges \u2014make the key findings required to impose a death sentence. \n \n With Thursday's rulings, trial courts across Florida face the prospect of being swamped by requests from death row inmates, asking to be resentenced. \n \n A substantial portion of them should be granted, said retired Circuit Judge O.H. Eaton Jr. of Sanford. \n \n \"There's going to be one hell of a lot of determinations as to whether these people are entitled to new penalty phases,\" he said. \n \n The flood of new petitions could result in a backlog that might take ten years to unjam, said Orange-Osceola Public Defender Robert Wesley. \n \n The rulings apply to more than 40 Central Florida convicted murderers. \n \n They include Bessman Okafor, who in 2012 killed an Orange County man who was about to testify against him at a home invasion trial; ax murderer John Buzia, a handyman convicted of killing an elderly Seminole County man in 2004; and Michael Gordon Reynolds, who beat and stabbed to death a Seminole County father, mother and 11-year-old daughter in 1998. \n \n In Orange and Osceola counties, 10 of 24 death row inmates could be eligible for new sentences, said Assistant State Attorney Ken Nunnelley. \n \n A moratorium since January \n \n Thursday's decision is the result of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in January. \n \n By a vote of 8-1, that court ruled that jurors \u2014 not a judge \u2014 must specifically identify why someone convicted of a capital crime should be put to death. \n \n That case involved Timothy Lee Hurst, a Pensacola man convicted of murdering his boss at a Popeyes Fried Chicken restaurant in 1998 with a box cutter, then putting her body in a freezer. \n \n The high court found that Florida's death penalty statute was unconstitutional, but left it to the Florida Supreme Court to decide whether the ruling should apply retroactively. \n \n The state has not executed an inmate since then. \n \n The state supreme court has issued several death penalty rulings in the interim. Some hinted that it would interpret the Hurst decision broadly, but each stopped short of spelling it out. \n \n On Thursday, that changed. The court laid it out: Every death penalty handed down in Florida since 2002 is unconstitutional. That's 55 percent of the state's death row population. \n \n That's because, in 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a ruling \u2014 Ring v. Arizona \u2014 that generally said the same thing to the state of Arizona that the high court said to Florida in the Hurst decision 14 years later: Juries \u2014 not judges \u2014 must decide whether the death penalty is appropriate. \n \n \"Florida's capital sentencing statute has essentially been unconstitutional since Ring in 2002,\" the court wrote in one of Thursday's rulings, that of John F. Mosley, a Jacksonville-area man given the death penalty for placing his infant son in a plastic bag in 2004 and allowing him to suffocate. \n \n The Florida Legislature rewrote the death penalty statute last winter, giving juries more authority, and Gov. Rick Scott signed it into law on March 7, but in October, the Florida Supreme Court threw it out, saying it was unconstitutional because it failed to require a unanimous vote by jurors before the death penalty could be imposed. \n \n As a consequence, the state currently has no death penalty statute. \n \n 384 inmates on death row \n \n One of the factors the Florida Supreme Court had to evaluate was the level of disruption its ruling would create at trial courts around the state. \n \n It concluded that including all 384 death row inmates would be too burdensome. \n \n Even so, it set the stage for what could become nearly 200 resentencings: mini-trials at which a new jury would listen to evidence then rule whether the defendant should be given the death penalty. \n \n It will not be easy, Wesley said. \n \n Inmates must individually petition the court, and prosecutors will have a chance to argue that their sentences were fair, Nunnelley said. \n \n If a judge sides with the inmate, a new jury would decide whether he or she should be sentenced to death. If their decision is not unanimous, the inmate would be sentenced to life in prison. \n \n \"Witnesses will have died. Memories will have failed. People will have disappeared,\" Wesley said. \n \n Eaton predicted that most inmates would qualify for resentencing. The most likely exceptions, he said, were those who chose to have a judge \u2014 not a jury \u2014 handle the penalty phase of their trials and those whose juries voted 12-0 in favor of the death penalty. \n \n Thursday's other ruling came in the case of Mark James Asay, who was convicted of killing two people, a black man and a transvestite, in 1987 in Jacksonville. \n \n He was scheduled to be executed March 17, but that was put on hold after the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Hurst case. \n \n On Thursday, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that Asay was not entitled to a new sentencing hearing because his trial and initial round of appeals played out before 2002. \n \n The state has executed one person who might have benefited from Thursday's ruling: Oscar Ray Bolin Jr., who was put to death in January for murdering three young women in the Tampa Bay area in 1986. \n \n rstutzman@orlandosentinel.com and glotan@orlandosentinel.com ||||| The 6-1 ruling in a death sentence appeal says that Death Row inmates are not entitled to a re-sentencing unless their case was finalized after a 2002 ruling. Miami Herald File ||||| \n \n Death penalty opponents demonstrating against an execution in Florida in 2014. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) \n \n The Florida Supreme Court said Thursday that some death-row prisoners there may be able to seek new sentences, a decision that could impact hundreds of inmates and ends months of uncertainty surrounding capital punishment in one of the country\u2019s leading death penalty states. \n \n While the court\u2019s ruling means that many inmates could potentially avoid execution, many others on the state\u2019s death row \u2014 the second-largest in the country, trailing only California \u2014 were deemed ineligible for this resentencing in a separate ruling Thursday. \n \n The decisions Thursday, along with doubt that has suffused Florida\u2019s death penalty for most of this year, stemmed from a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in January striking down the state\u2019s death sentencing scheme as unconstitutional. \n \n That ruling effectively froze the death penalty in Florida, contributing to a nationwide plunge in executions. But the ruling left unsaid whether it was retroactive and did not specify what it meant for the nearly 400 inmates on the state\u2019s death row. \n \n [Executions in the United States just fell to a 25-year low] \n \n In a pair of rulings Thursday, the Florida Supreme Court offered its clearest answers yet to that question. The justices said that the January decision will not apply retroactively to death sentences finalized before a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling involving capital sentences in Arizona. \n \n Florida death row inmate Timothy Lee Hurst, the inmate for whom Hurst v. Florida is named. (Florida Department of Corrections via Reuters) \n \n But in another opinion, the Florida Supreme Court said the ruling striking down Florida\u2019s death penalty would apply retroactively to any inmates whose sentences were finalized after that 2002 case. That could lead to resentencing for potentially more than 200 inmates, according to the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s estimate, a number that would exceed the entire death row populations in most states. \n \n The rulings Thursday hinged on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s January decision in Hurst v. Florida, which saw the justices strike down the state\u2019s sentencing scheme because it gave too much power to judges, rather than juries. In the Hurst ruling, the justices determined that Florida\u2019s system violated the Sixth Amendment, pointing to the 2002 determination the high court made in the case Ring v. Arizona, which found fault with a system that let a judge\u2019s sentencing determination outweigh that of a jury. \n \n [Florida\u2019s death penalty was deemed unconstitutional, so lawmakers rewrote it \u2014 and it was struck down again] \n \n In its new rulings Thursday, the Florida Supreme Court does not question the constitutionality of the death penalty. The justices also stress that their rulings will not impact the guilty verdicts that led to the death sentences, writing in one opinion that \u201cno defendant will receive a new guilt phase or be released from prison while a new penalty takes place.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe difference is not guilt or innocence but, instead, life or death,\u201d the opinion states. \n \n Inmates eligible to try to seek new sentences will not all obtain them, nor are all guaranteed to have new penalty phases, the same ruling notes. \n \n It was not immediately clear the exact number of inmates who would be eligible for a resentencing hearing under the rulings Thursday, but the Florida Supreme Court estimated in one of its rulings that a little more than half of the state\u2019s death row had sentences finalized after the Ring decision in 2002. \n \n [Florida had been weighing what to do with nearly 400 death row inmates] \n \n \u201cThe upshot is that between 150 and 200 people will need to be resentenced, opening old wounds and costing taxpayers millions of dollars,\u201d Robert Smith, director of the Fair Punishment Project at Harvard Law School, said in a statement. \u201cYou can thank Florida\u2019s prosecutors for this situation.\u201d \n \n The rulings capped off what has been a chaotic year for Florida\u2019s death penalty. In January, Florida carried out the country\u2019s first execution of the year, a lethal injection that took place just days before the Supreme Court struck down the state\u2019s death penalty system. \n \n Florida Gov. Rick Scott. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \n \n Florida lawmakers quickly revamped the state\u2019s law in March to better adhere to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling and try to resume executions, but the Florida Supreme Court struck down the new law in October, saying that it was unconstitutional because juries were not required to be unanimous about sentences. \n \n The offices of Gov. Rick Scott (R) and Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) both said they were reviewing the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s latest rulings. \n \n The justices ruled Thursday that Hurst must apply retroactively in the case of John F. Mosley, a 52-year-old on death row for killing his infant son in 2004. (Mosley was also sentenced to life in prison for killing his girlfriend in the same episode.) They vacated Mosley\u2019s death sentence and remanded the case for a new penalty phase. \n \n In a partial concurrence and partial dissent, Justice Charles T. Canady, joined by Justice Ricky Polston, pilloried the decision to vacate Mosley\u2019s death sentence. Canady wrote that the ruling \u201cunjustifiably plunges the administration of the death penalty in Florida into turmoil that will undoubtedly extend for years.\u201d \n \n Canady, who has been mentioned by President-elect Trump as a possible U.S. Supreme Court nominee, was also joined by Polston when he dissented from the Florida Supreme Court ruling striking down the state\u2019s rewritten death penalty law in October. \n \n Justice James E.C. Perry, who retires from the court later this month, also concurred in part and dissented in part, arguing that Mosley\u2019s death sentence should be vacated and automatically changed to a life sentence. \n \n This stance was offered earlier this year in an amicus brief filed by a high-profile group that included three former chief justices of the state\u2019s Supreme Court, who had pointed to a state statute requiring that death sentences must be replaced by life sentences if \u201cthe death penalty in a capital felony is held to be unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court or the United States Supreme Court.\u201d Bondi, the attorney general, argued in court filings that the Supreme Court had only \u201cstruck a portion\u201d of the statute, rather than the death penalty itself. \n \n As such, today's Florida Supreme Court ruling is one of the most concretely consequential death penalty opinions in 40 years. \u2014 David Menschel (@davidminpdx) December 22, 2016 \n \n The justices ruled in the case of Mark James Asay, 52 \u2014 who was sentenced to death for two killings in 1987 \u2014 that he was not eligible for resentencing under Hurst because his sentence was final before the Ring decision was issued in 2002. They also denied other petitions Asay made and lifted a stay of execution they issued in his case earlier this year. The sharply divided court was particularly vocal about this case, with four justices filing additional opinions. \n \n In a third ruling issued Thursday, the justices also determined that a death sentence handed down in another case violated Hurst. As a result, they vacated that death sentence and remanded it to a trial court for a new penalty phase. \n \n Further reading: \n \n Florida Supreme Court halts scheduled execution after debate over state\u2019s death penalty \n \n The Florida Supreme Court heard arguments about what to do post-Hurst earlier this year \n \n Why the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Florida\u2019s death penalty in the first place \n \n Supreme Court Justice Breyer: California embodies the death penalty\u2019s \u2018fundamental defects\u2019",

(AP) \u2014 The highly secretive, daylong law enforcement operation around the Arizona border with Mexico resulted in the arrest of two dozen alleged high-level Mexican drug cartel members, according to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman. \n \n The sting known as Mexican Operation Diablo Express took place all of Friday as numerous law enforcement agencies converged onto Lukeville, Arizona, which sits on the border with Mexico. \n \n Homeland Security Investigations, a unit of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, helped Mexican authorities nab 24 alleged members of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of Mexico's biggest drug-trafficking organizations, who were operating around Sonoyta, Mexico, and the U.S. border, spokeswoman Gillian M. Christensen said. The DEA, FBI, Customs and Border Protection and Arizona state and local agencies were on hand to assist. \n \n \"The targeted Sinaloa cell has been responsible for the importation of millions of pounds of illegal drugs, including marijuana, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine, into the United States from Mexico during its existence.

The work is on view as part of \u201cAnish Kapoor: Works, Thoughts, Experiments,\u201d the artist\u2019s first Portuguese museum survey, where the wall text notes that \u201cthe sculpture is an expression of Kapoor\u2019s interests in the formal and metaphoric play between light and darkness, inside and outside, the contained and the infinite, which underpins his sculptural oeuvre.\u201d \n \n \u201cAn accident happened,\u201d Fernando Rodrigues Pereira, the museum\u2019s press officer, told artnet News in an email. \u201cNow this installation is temporarily closed.\u201d The exhibition had displayed warning signs and a staff member was manning the room when the man fell, as per established security protocols. \n \n \u201cThe visitor has already left the hospital and he is recovering well,\u201d Pereira added. \n \n Visitors enter the installation through a small doorway leading into a freestanding concrete and stucco room, approximately 20 feet square. In the center of the floor is a circular pit, the sides painted black so that it at first appears solid, hiding its true depths. Kapoor designed Descent Into Limbo to appear like an endless chasm in space; looking down into it is a dizzying experience. \n \n A representative of the museum told the Art Newspaper on Friday that there are plans to reopen the installation \u201cin a few days.\u201d \n \n On the artist\u2019s website, the work, which was first created for documenta IX in 1992, is described as a \u201ccubed building with a dark hole in the floor.

Currently on exhibit at the Serralves Museum in Porto, Descent Into Limbo by Anish Kapoor includes an actual eight-foot hole that\u2019s painted black\u2014so it appears to have no depth at all. \n \n According to Britain\u2019s Times, attendees of previous showings of the work have questioned \u201cwhether there really was a hole in the floor or whether it was simply a circle painted with an extremely dark black paint.\u201d Presumably there will be no doubts going forward. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Though the Descent Into Limbo installation was reportedly surrounded with warning signs and staffers warning visitors not to get too close, there was no barrier around it. How the museumgoer, whom Portugal\u2019s Publico reports was an Italian man in his 60s, was able to step into the hole isn\u2019t known, but he was briefly hospitalized for the eight-foot fall. The museum closed the exhibit to assess what happened, but says it plans to reopen it soon. \n \n In addition to being known for his over-sized installations (including the giant reflective Cloud Gate \u201cbean\u201d in Chicago), Kapoor made headlines in 2016 when he secured the exclusive artistic rights to a physics-defying material called Vantablack. Developed by a British company called Surrey NanoSystems, the material is able to trap photons in-between lab-grown carbon nanotubes, which bounce around until they\u2019re eventually absorbed. Just a scant 0.035 percent of visible light is reflected by an object covered in Vantablack, making it impossible to see any curves or contours\u2014or to accurately gauge the depth of a hole if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at. \n \n Descent Into Limbo debuted years before Vantablack was announced to the public, and was instead created using a dark paint that produces the same depthless, black hole effect.

        "context": "In a post on the first day of this year, I noted the surprisingly rapid decline in e-book sales growth over the course of 2012. The trend appears to be continuing this year. The Association of American Publishers reports that in the first quarter of 2013, overall e-book sales in the U.S. trade market grew by just 5 percent over where they were in the same period in 2012. The explosive growth of the last few years has basically petered out, according to the AAP numbers*: \n \n Looking at the major segments of the trade market, e-book sales were up 13.6 percent in the adult segment, down 30.1 percent in the children\u2019s segment, and down 0.6 percent in the religious segment. The children\u2019s segment accounted for a big part of e-book growth last year, thanks in large measure to the Hunger Games franchise, but that boost has proved temporary. \n \n E-books are still taking share from printed books, as overall trade sales declined by 4.7 percent in the quarter, but the anemic growth of the electronic market calls into question the strength of the so-called \u201cdigital revolution\u201d in the book business. E-books now represent a bit less than 25 percent of total book sales. That\u2019s an impressive share, but it\u2019s still a long way from dominance. Other big e-book markets also show signs of maturing. A new Nielsen Research report indicates that UK e-book sales actually declined slightly in April from year-earlier levels. \n \n I speculated in my January post about some reasons why e-books may fall short of expectations: \n \n 1. We may be discovering that e-books are well suited to some types of books (like genre fiction) but not well suited to other types (like nonfiction and literary fiction) and are well suited to certain reading situations (plane trips) but less well suited to others (lying on the couch at home). The e-book may turn out to be more a complement to the printed book, as audiobooks have long been, rather than an outright substitute. 2. The early adopters, who tend also to be the enthusiastic adopters, have already made their move to e-books. Further converts will be harder to come by, particularly given the fact that 59 percent of American book readers say they have \u201cno interest\u201d in e-books, according to the Bowker report. 3. The advantages of printed books have been underrated, while the advantages of e-books have been overrated. 4. The early buyers of e-readers quickly filled them with lots of books, most of which have not been read. The motivation to buy more e-books may be dissipating as a result. Novelty fades. 5. The shift from e-readers to tablets is putting a damper on e-book sales. With dedicated readers, pretty much the only thing you can do is buy and read books. With tablets, you have a whole lot of other options. (To put it another way: On an e-reader, the e-reading app is always running. On a tablet, it isn\u2019t.) 6. E-book prices have not fallen the way many expected. There\u2019s not a big price difference between an e-book and a paperback. (It\u2019s possible, suggests one industry analyst, that Amazon is seeing a plateau in e-book sales and so is less motivated to take a loss on them for strategic reasons.) \n \n Those still seem reasonable. Most intriguing, to me, is the possible link between the decline in dedicated e-readers (as multitasking tablets take over) and the softening of e-book sales. Are tablets less conducive to book buying and reading than e-readers were? \n \n UPDATE: A little more confirming data: A recent report on the Canadian market, from BookNet Canada, indicates that the market share of e-books peaked in the first quarter of 2012 at 17.6% and then started falling, dropping to 12.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012. BookNet sees evidence that e-books may be \u201cplateauing\u201d at about 15% of the Canadian market: \u201c\u2018The research suggests that the ebook market in Canada may have reached a plateau,\u2019 says BookNet Canada President and CEO Noah Genner. \u2018Early 2013 data backs this up. So far, we\u2019re seeing the same pattern repeating itself.'\u201d \n \n And this from a March 2013 report on the \u201cstalling\u201d of e-books in the UK market: \u201cYet even as book sales continue to move online, ebooks are making notably slow gains, and likely slowing down the etailing book market overall. Bowker found that ebooks\u2019 share of the UK market reached a high of 13% in July 2012, driven upward by ebook purchases of \u2018Fifty Shades of Grey.\u2019 But by November the share had fallen back down to 9%.\u201d (Even without \u201cFifty Shades,\u201d the current ebook bestseller list in the UK is \u201cfilled with erotic fiction,\u201d reports The Guardian.) \n \n UPDATE 2: The original version of this post described the Nielsen data as being worldwide; it actually reflects only the UK market. \n \n *Sources of AAP data in chart: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013. The AAP doesn\u2019t seem to release its sales reports directly to the public, so collecting the data, from secondary sources, is a bit of a trial. In general, good information on book sales is hard to come by. ||||| Pin Share 3 31 Shares \n \n The AAP has put out a new press release today with some tidbits on the the state of the US book market. The data is drawn from the StatShot report, and while I don't have all the stats available but what I do have is a little startling. \n \n Update: If you came to this post via one of the articles which argued ebook sales are flattening, don't believe it. That conclusion is wrong, and I can prove it. \n \n The AAP is reporting that the 1192 publishers which submit their sales data to the AAP did not see a significant increase in the ebook market in the first quarter of this year. Sales of adult ebooks increased by 13%, but children's ebooks dropped by 30% (religious ebooks held steady). \n \n The overall ebook market grew from $374.8 million to $393.6 million, or about 5%. That is far below the growth reported in previous years, but it is still good news. The AAP also reported the total reported book sales dropped by 4.7% (from $1.5 billion to $1.4 billion) thanks to a severe drop in the children's and YA segment (24.6%). \n \n In that context the 5% growth is not bad. Audiobooks also increased by 14% ($24.8 million to $28.3 million), so there is some good news. \n \n In spite of the spectacular growth of ebooks in 2008 to 2011, we all know that eventually the ride would come to a stop as the growth of ebook market share slowed. TBH I didn't expect it to happen so quickly. \n \n Of course, these statistics only represent publishers sending their data to the AAP and not the entirety of the US ebook market. One can still hope that indie pub saw better growth than this. \n \n For those who are interested, here is the data: \n \n image by historygradguy ||||| July 30, 2013 \n \n New research on worldwide consumption of ebooks from Nielsen suggests that we could be at the end of the period of explosive growth for digital reading, as year-on-year sales fell for the first time. \n \n \n \n Nielsen\u2019s new \"Understanding the E-Book Consumer\" for July 2013, which is based on data from the Kantar World Panel, also contains some better news for proponents of digital reading. It predicts that ebooks will overtake sales of print books in 2014, with total sales expected to rise to 47 million units. This will put total ebook sales 300,000 ahead of their print equivalents and mean that electronic books account for 48% of the overall fiction market. \n \n \n \n Away from the predictions, those parts of Nielsen Kantar\u2019s report that are based on historic data show a more mixed picture for publishers. Sales of ebooks fell for the third consecutive month in April 2013, showing a (very slight) year-on-year decline of 0.1% - the first time such a thing has been recorded in this market. Nielsen attributes this slowdown to the lack of a star performing title in children\u2019s and young adult publishing in 2013 to replicate the success that Suzanne Collins\u2019 The Hunger Games trilogy enjoyed last year. \n \n \n \n Nielsen\u2019s data for the UK market mirrors recent statistics published by the Association of American Publishers in early July. This reported that the days of double or even triple digit growth for the market might now be gone, with ebook sales growing by only 5% to $393.6 million in the first quarter of 2013. It also suggested that the huge success of The Hunger Games in 2012 may have been a one-off event that helped to skew expectations of the market this year. \n \n \n \n As ebook sales look set to take just under half of the total fiction market in the UK and more than a fifth (22%) of the overall UK book market, according to recent Bowker Market Research, it is only natural that the rate of growth would slow. As the overall market for ebooks gets bigger, publishers will need to sell ever greater volumes of ebooks in order to report significant growth, which is harder to achieve in a larger market. \n \n \n \n What these results do indicate very strongly, however, is the impact that just one runaway hit can have on moving the publishing market on both sides of the Atlantic, and the ultimate importance that blockbuster book sales still have to publishers\u2019 bottom lines.",

She was also buried with a copper headband and a copper coin, archaeologists found. \n \n How do you keep a demon from disturbing the living? A blade to the throat should do the trick. \n \n A few skeletons unearthed in a 400-year-old Polish cemetery have been discovered with sickles placed around their necks. Archaeologists believe this strange burial practice is evidence of a belief in magic and a fear of demons. \n \n The sickle burials were found at Drawsko cemetery, a site in northeastern Poland that dates from the 17th to the 18th centuries. Archaeologists, including Marek Polcyn, a visiting scholar at Lakehead University in Canada, have excavated more than 250 graves there since 2008. \n \n Among those graves were four skeletons with sickles placed at their throats, and a fifth skeleton with a sickle placed over its hips. Previously, these burials had been described as \"vampire\" burials, with the sickles interpreted as a way to prevent the dead from reanimating and terrorizing the living. But in a new study detailed in the journal Antiquity, Polcyn and co-author Elzbieta Gajda, of the Muzeum Ziemi Czarnkowskiej, now reject that characterization. (\"We deliberately dismiss the interpretation of a revenant (i.e. vampire),\" isn't something you read in an academic paper every day.) [See Photos of the Sickle Burials at Drawsko Cemetery] \n \n Instead, the archaeologists prefer to use the blanket term \"anti-demonic\" to talk about these burials, partly because vampires weren't the only kinds of evil incarnations of the dead, according to traditional folk beliefs in the region. But also, the sickle graves were afforded funerary privileges that weren't usually extended to \"vampires\" buried elsewhere: They were given Christian burials in sacred ground alongside other members of the community, and their corpses do not appear to have been desecrated or mutilated. \n \n In another sign that the people buried with sickles probably were not outsiders, scientists who studied chemical signatures locked in the teeth of these corpses found that all five individuals were locals. (They published those results in a paper in PLOS ONE last year.) \n \n \"The magical and ritual meaning of this gesture seems beyond doubt,\" Polcyn and Gajda wrote, adding, however, that the sickle might have had more than one ritualistic meaning. The tool may have been intended to keep the dead in their graves under the threat of cutting their throat, but it also might have been used to prevent evil forces from tormenting their souls. What's more, the use of a tool made of iron, which had to undergo a transformation in fire, could symbolize the passage from life to death, the authors wrote. [7 Strange Ways Humans Act Like Vampires] \n \n Even though Christianity was the dominant religion in Poland at the time this cemetery was used, traditions from old Slavic pagan faith and folk belief systems still existed, including a belief in demons. Besides the sickles, there is not much that makes these graves unique, so the scientists aren't sure exactly what about these people made them demonic. They may have been thought to have supernatural powers in life, or they might have had physical characteristics considered suspicious (which might have included \"an exceptionally hairy body,\" a unibrow, a large head and a red complexion, the authors said, citing traditional Polish folklore). \n \n These people also might have died in a traumatic fashion, without any time for the appropriate rites and rituals to make for a smooth spiritual transition into death \u2014 a concept some archaeologists call a \"bad death.\" While some of the people buried with sickles may have simply died of old age, one of them, a girl, died as a teenager. The authors speculated that she might have met a violent and untimely end, perhaps through drowning, suicide or murder. Unfortunately for archaeologists, however, this death didn't leave its mark on the girl's bones. \n \n Polcyn and Gajda wrote that they hope further scientific tests on the corpses, such as biomolecular analyses, will help them understand more specifically what led the dead in Drawsko to be buried with sickles. \n \n Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

It was made of sheet gold with finely incised decoration. \n \n Some of the thousands of studs from the dagger. Each stud is thinner than a human hair. They were set into the wood at a density of over 1,000 per square centimeter to create a zig-zag pattern. \n \n Produced nearly 4,000 years ago, more than 1,000 years before the invention of any form of magnifying glass, the dagger was decorated with 140,000 tiny studs. The ultra-fine craftwork entailed extremely tiny components such as microscopic gold pins and gold wires. According to optic experts, only children and teenagers, and those adults who had become myopic naturally or due to the nature of their work as children, would have been able to create and manufacture such tiny objects. The eye-stressing work would have blinded most child workers. The image shows how the studs are placed in straight lines and the heads overlap each other like fish scales. \n \n This watercolor shows the dagger handle as excavated by William Cunnington in 1808. \n \n Among the buried objects, one of the finest was a dagger with an intricately decorated wooden handle. Today only fragments of the original handle survive. Here fragments of the 4,000-year-old wooden handle is mounted on a modern wood reconstruction. \n \n Reconstruction of the burial of the Bush Barrow mound.

NEWS: Stonehenge Intricate Treasures Made by Children \n \n Evidence of \u201canti-demonic\u201d funerary practices, with sickles placed around the throats of the deceased possibly to ward off demons, has been found in a 400-year-old cemetery in Poland. \n \n Researchers examined more than 250 human skeletons which were excavated since 2008 from a post Medieval cemetery in Drawsko, a rural settlement site in northwestern Poland. \n \n Dating to the 17th and 18th centuries, the remains represented individuals of all ages and both sexes and included five unique interments with sickles. \n \n Photos: Intricate Treasures From Stonehenge Burial \n \n Play Video Ancient Lost Army Found?

        "context": "\n \n Former Alabama chief justice and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore on Sept. 26, 2017. (Brynn Anderson/AP) \n \n Roy Moore's Senate campaign was jolted by an allegation Thursday that he initiated sexual touching with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32. \n \n Moore (R) has denied the allegations. Alabama state Auditor Jim Zeigler (R), though, is taking it a step further. In some rather remarkable and often nonsensical comments, the Moore supporter's argument isn't that Moore didn't do these things, but that even the conduct described in The Washington Post's report is a-okay with both him and the law. \n \n Zeigler's comments came in an interview with the Washington Examiner. Let's break them down: \n \n \u201cThere is nothing to see here,\u201d Alabama State Auditor Jim Ziegler told the Washington Examiner. \u201cThe allegations are that a man in his early 30s dated teenage girls. Even the Washington Post report says that he never had sexual intercourse with any of the girls and never attempted sexual intercourse.\u201d \n \n The first problem here is that the allegation isn't just that Moore \u201cdated\u201d 14-year-old Leigh Corfman but, rather, that he removed her clothes and touched her, and guided her hand to touch his penis. Corfman says this was unwanted. \n \n And regardless of whether this was consensual, this kind of activity would sure seem to be illegal. As The Post notes, Alabama law in 1979, as now, placed the age of consent at 16. It would be \u201csexual abuse in the second degree\u201d for someone 19 or older to engage in sexual contact with someone younger than 16 but older than 12, and sexual contact is defined as the touching of sexual or intimate parts. \n \n Here's more from Zeigler: \n \n Moore never had \u201csexual intercourse\u201d with the girl. Their relationship \u201chappened almost 40 years ago.\u201d And finally, \u201cRoy Moore fell in love with one of the younger women.\u201d Moore began dating his wife Kayla around this time, according to Ziegler. \u201cHe dated her. He married her, and they\u2019ve been married about 35 years. They\u2019re blessed with a wonderful marriage and his wife Kayla is 14 years younger than Moore.\u201d \n \n Moore's wife, Kayla, is indeed 14 years his junior, but the law is less concerned with age differences and more concerned with whether one of the parties is a minor who isn't able to consent. A 70-year-old and a 56-year-old is not the same thing, for example, as a 28-year-old and a 14-year-old. \n \n And finally, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: \n \n \u201cTake the Bible \u2014 Zachariah and Elizabeth, for instance. Zachariah was extremely old to marry Elizabeth and they became the parents of John the Baptist,\u201d Ziegler says, choosing his words carefully before invoking Christ. \u201cAlso take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s just nothing immoral or illegal here,\u201d Ziegler concluded. \u201cMaybe just a little bit unusual.\u201d \n \n First, there are issues with Zeigler's Bible references. Both Zachariah and Elizabeth were elderly when John the Baptist was born; it wasn't that she was young and Zachariah was \u201cextremely old.\u201d \n \n Second, comparing modern age-of-consent laws to biblical times seems to be a slippery slope. Many things from 2,000 years ago don't apply today. Girls were often betrothed early in their teenage years, for example. \n \n And third, there is something called the virgin birth. Here is the definition of virgin. As The Post's Michelle Boorstein writes in her piece breaking this all down: \n \n In the Bible, Mary is the mother of Jesus, and Joseph became her husband. Beliefs about the specific story of Joseph and Mary and Jesus\u2019 birth vary widely in Christian history and across traditions. Mary is referred to in scripture as a virgin, but there is disagreement about what that means. Generally, however, Christians believe that Mary was a virgin when he was born. Joseph is usually referred to as Jesus\u2019 \u201cfather\u201d or a father figure. ... Multiple evangelical leaders slammed Ziegler. \u201cBringing Joseph and Mary into a modern-day molestation accusation, where a 32-year-old prosecutor is accused of molesting a 14-year-old girl, is simultaneously ridiculous and blasphemous,\u201d said Ed Stetzer, a pastor and church consultant who chairs the Billy Graham Center of Church, Mission and Evangelism at Wheaton College. \u201cEven those who followed ancient marriage customs, which we would not follow today, knew the difference between molesting and marriage.\u201d \n \n Further reading: \"Alabama state official defends Roy Moore, citing Joseph and Mary: \u2018They became parents of Jesus\u2019\" ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann \n \n First Read is your briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter. \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 On Thursday morning, we told you that the December 12 Alabama Senate race was something you should put on your calendar, especially after Democrats\u2019 big wins earlier in the week. But we had no idea what was going to happen just hours later: The Washington Post reported that a woman said Republican nominee Roy Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 and he was 32. \n \n The news could fundamentally transform the political situation in Washington. If Moore loses next month \u2014 and we stress the word \u201cif\u201d \u2014 then the GOP\u2019s Senate majority goes from 52-48 to 51-49. \n \n Why is that important? For one thing, it makes it much more realistic for Democrats to capture control of the U.S. Senate in 2018. Democrats would need to win Arizona and Nevada (two races where they have at least a 50-50 shot of victory) and hold on to all of their vulnerable seats. That\u2019s a tall order, of course, but it\u2019s much easier than having to put a Texas or Tennessee on the map to win Senate control. Bottom line: If there\u2019s a wave in 2018, Democrats will have an easier shot of having to flip two Senate seats instead of three to win back the Senate. \n \n In addition, a 51-49 GOP majority in the Senate could imperil the Republican tax plan. Senate Republicans are already having to walk a fine line in placating Sens. Rand Paul (who opposes the tax increases in the GOP plan), Bob Corker (who\u2019s worried about increasing the deficit) and Susan Collins (who is against some of the tax cuts for the wealthy). A 52-48 majority means Senate Republicans can afford to lose two GOP votes, assuming all Democrats oppose the legislation. But with a 51-49 majority, Republicans can lose only one GOP senator. \n \n Now you might say that there\u2019s no way (or little way) that a Republican could lose in Alabama, a state Trump won by a whopping 28 points in 2016. But consider: \n \n Before yesterday, Moore\u2019s lead was just in the high single digits or low double digits, according to the polls. That isn\u2019t a bulletproof lead; \n \n Moore has been a controversial figure in Alabama for more than a decade; \n \n Democratic opponent Doug Jones has owned the TV airwaves for an entire month, with ads like this: \u201cI can work with Republicans better than Roy Moore can work with anyone\u201d; \n \n And the race is a one-on-one special election that takes place two weeks before Christmas, so it will be a low-turnout affair. There is no other race on the ballot. \n \n This isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s a slam dunk that Moore loses after yesterday. But we\u2019re not sure enough people realize how dangerous the political situation is for the GOP. \n \n Could Alabama Republicans pull what New Jersey Democrats did in 2002? \n \n And given the situation \u2014 as well as the facts that ballots have already been printed and that state law mandates that a candidate must withdraw 76 days before the election to be removed from the ballot (and we\u2019re a month out now) \u2014 NBC\u2019s Steve Kornacki reminds us of what happened in New Jersey in 2002: \n \n \u201cIn 2002, New Jersey state law set a deadline of 51 days pre-election for a party to switch candidates, but incumbent Bob Torricelli, fresh off his reprimand by the Senate ethics committee and faced with collapsing poll numbers, dropped out 34 days before the vote. Democrats went to court to ask for a ballot switch anyway, and the state Supreme Court \u2013 regarded as one of the most liberal in the country \u2013 gave it to them. Republicans howled in protest and took it to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case. Frank Lautenberg then subbed in for Torricelli, and won the election easily.\u201d \n \n The lesson: A party that controls the local political power and the courts can change the rules. \n \n But right now, it doesn\u2019t seem like Moore is going to withdraw from the contest. \"Judge Roy Moore has endured the most outlandish attacks on any candidate in the modern political arena, but this story in today\u2019s Washington Post alleging sexual impropriety takes the cake,\" Moore campaign chair Bill Armistead said in statement. \"National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate Doug Jones is in a death spiral, and this is their last ditch Hail Mary.\" \n \n Jonah Goldberg: Saving Moore isn\u2019t worth it for Republicans \n \n Meanwhile, conservative writer Jonah Goldberg criticizes the Republicans who are defending Moore. \u201c\u2026 I cannot grasp why so many people think it\u2019s a good idea to stand by a man who, if elected, will serve as a negative campaign ad made flesh. I get the argument that it\u2019s a \u2018binary choice!\u2019 But it\u2019s a binary choice now, because a bunch of people who want to see the GOP burn down made it one.\u201d \n \n Goldberg adds, \u201cIn the long run, a Senator Moore would cost Republicans more seats than the one he might give them. He\u2019d be an albatross for every elected Republican, including President Trump, who will be asked to take a side on every scene in the clown show Moore would bring to Washington. And every conservative who ever denounces a Democrat for immoral behavior or insane views will be asked, \u2018Oh yeah, why did you support Roy Moore then?\u2019 Saving Steve Bannon\u2019s reputation as the leader of some (doomed) movement certainly isn\u2019t worth it, not for the cost to the GOP not to mention your own souls.\u201d \n \n Want to understand why it appeared the GOP was racing for the Moore exits? Goldberg captures that. \n \n Senate Republicans unveil their tax plan \n \n Speaking of the GOP tax effort, Senate Republicans unveiled their plan yesterday, per NBC\u2019s Alex Seitz-Wald, Benjy Sarlin and Leigh Ann Caldwell. \u201cThe Senate plan differs in some key ways from the version introduced by the House last week... The Senate bill maintains the current seven individual income-tax brackets, unlike the House's four, and lowers the top rate to 38.5 percent, while the House bill maintains it at 39.6 percent but applies it to higher income.\u201d \n \n \u201cAnd unlike the House version, the Senate bill would fully repeal the deduction for state and local taxes, which has become a sticking point with GOP congressmen from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, which tend to lean Democratic, whose constituents depend on that deduction.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe House included a deduction for the first $10,000 in property taxes to appease those members, but the Senate, which has fewer Republicans from such states, has no such provision in its bill. In the end, the House may be forced to swallow whatever the Senate passes and it's unclear if dissenting lawmakers from high-tax states have enough numbers to prevent it.\u201d \n \n Was Michael Flynn discussing returning a Turkish opponent living on U.S. soil during the transition? \n \n NBCs Carol Lee and Julia Ainsley: \u201cFederal investigators are examining whether former national security adviser Michael Flynn met with senior Turkish officials just weeks before President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration about a potential quid-pro-quo in which Flynn would be paid to secretly carry out directives from Ankara while in the White House, according to multiple people familiar with the investigation.\u201d \n \n More: \u201cInvestigators for Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s attack on the U.S. presidential election recently questioned witnesses about the alleged December 2016 meeting between Flynn and senior Turkish officials, two people knowledgeable with the interviews said. The questions were part of a line of inquiry regarding Flynn\u2019s lobbying efforts on behalf of Turkey.\u201d \n \n \u201cFour people familiar with the investigation said Mueller is looking into whether Flynn discussed in the late December meeting orchestrating the return to Turkey of a chief rival of Turkish President Recep Erdogan who is living in the U.S. Additionally, three people familiar with the investigation said, investigators are examining whether Flynn and other participants discussed a way to free a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab, who is jailed in the U.S. Zarrab is facing federal charges that he helped Iran skirt U.S. sanctions.\u201d ||||| Story highlights Roy Moore's brother defended him \"to the hilt\" amid the escalating controversy over allegations of sexual misconduct against him \n \n Jerry Moore firmly denied the charges against his brother and analogized his brother's situation to the persecution of Jesus Christ \n \n (CNN) Roy Moore's brother is defending the GOP Senate candidate \"to the hilt\" amid the escalating controversy over allegations of sexual misconduct against him, according to CNN correspondent Martin Savidge, who spoke to the brother on the phone. \n \n Jerry Moore firmly denied the allegations against his brother and drew an analogy between his situation and the persecution of Jesus Christ, Savidge reported Friday in an interview with CNN's John Berman. \n \n Savidge spoke to Jerry Moore on Friday morning, one day after an explosive Washinton Post report detailed allegations that the Republican Senate candidate from Alabama pursued sexual relationships with several teens when they were between the ages of 14 and 18 and he was in his thirties, including an alleged sexual encounter with the 14-year-old, who would not have been at the age of legal consent under Alabama law. \n \n Jerry Moore said, \"he knows ... that the allegations against Roy Moore are not true, not true at all,\" Savidge reported.

Lavish lifestyles for a few but poverty for too many others.\" \n \n He said he would take a message to the leaders of the G20 leading economies who are due to meet in Cannes later this week. \n \n \"Think about our children, think about the future with vision and foresight.\" \n \n He said he would call for the world's poor not to be forgotten in a time of economic austerity and for women and young people to be given a proper voice in their future. \n \n In addition to baby Nargis in India, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Cambodia have all identified seven billionth babies. \n \n 'Good luck' \n \n Every minute, 51 babies are born in India, 11 of them in the most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. \n \n Nargis was born to Vinita and Ajay Kumar on Monday morning in a small government-run hospital in Mall village, nearly 50km (31 miles) from the state capital, Lucknow, a Plan International official told the BBC. \n \n The daughter of a poor farmer, Nargis was chosen as the seventh billionth baby to focus attention on the ills of female foeticide and India's skewed sex ratio, the organisation said. \n \n Hundreds of thousands of female foetuses are aborted in India every year, even though sex-selective terminations and the use of ultrasound technology for foetal sex-determination are illegal there. \n \n Photos of baby Nargis were shown at a function attended by nearly 250 villagers at the hospital, the BBC's Ram Dutt Tripathi reports from Mall. \n \n Health officials presented the birth certificate to her father at the event. \n \n \"We were praying all along for a daughter,\" Ajay Kumar said. \"She is Lakshmi [Hindu goddess of wealth], she will bring us good luck,\" he said. \n \n A street play staged at the event on the importance of the girl child saw many moist eyes among the audiences, our correspondent says. \n \n The person chosen by the UN as the world's symbolic six billionth person, Adnan Mevic, is now 12 years old. \n \n He was photographed in hospital in 1999 with the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. \n \n His family are living in relatively poor conditions in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, and have expressed disappointment that since they were visited by Mr Annan, they have heard nothing more from the UN. \n \n It is thought that this could be one reason why the UN has decided not to name a seven billionth child. ||||| This article is over 7 years old \n \n Danica May Camacho, a girl born in Philippine capital Manila, is chosen by UN to symbolically mark global population milestone \n \n The world's seven billionth baby has been born in a packed government-run hospital in the Philippines. \n \n Weighing 2.5kg (5.5lb), Danica May Camacho was chosen by the United Nations to be one of several children around the world who will symbolically represent the global population milestone. \n \n She was delivered just before midnight on Sunday amid an explosion of press camera flashes at Manila's Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital. \n \n \"She looks so lovely,\" her mother, Camille Dalura, whispered softly as she cradled her tiny newborn. \n \n \"I can't believe she is the world's seven billionth.\" \n \n Danica's name means morning star. She is a second child for Camille Dalura and Florante Camacho. \n \n The parents and the baby were met by officials from the UN, which named 31 October Seven Billion Day, aiming to draw attention to the challenges of the world's growing population. \n \n The accuracy of the projection has been questioned, with some groups arguing that the figure is more likely to be reached next year. \n \n UN officials nevertheless presented the baby and her parents with a small cake as she lay on her mother's chest wearing a knitted red hat. \n \n The family also received a scholarship grant for Danica's education from wellwishers and some money to help them open a shop. \n \n Previous children picked out at birth by the UN to mark world population milestones have complained that the international body forgot about them later in life. \n \n Both 12-year-old Adnan Nevic of Bosnia Herzogovina, the sixth billionth baby, and Matej Gaspar from Croatia, who was number five billion, have complained that the UN chose them at birth then largely ignored them. \n \n \"We saw Kofi Annan as almost like a godfather to him,\" Adnan's father, Jasminko, told the Guardian. \n \n Adnan said: \"He held me up when I was two days old but since then we have heard nothing from them.\" \n \n The UN Population Fund hopes to raise awareness about reproductive health, women's rights and inequality through the campaign. \n \n Countries around the world have held celebrations to mark the occasion, including a song contest in Zambia and a concert in Vietnam. \n \n The Philippines has 94.9 million people, according to a UN report, and 10% of girls aged 15 to 19 have been pregnant. \n \n Enrique Ona, the country's health secretary, said the birth offered his country an opportunity to address population-related problems.",

        "context": "LONDON - MPs on Monday debated a petition to ban U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from Britain over remarks on Muslims, but while describing his comments as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d, most said the ban would go against free speech. \n \n Members of parliament said Trump should be allowed into Britain where his views could be challenged, that a ban would give him more publicity or that it was not for Britain to get involved in U.S. affairs. \n \n Trump caused outrage last month with his comments that Muslims should be banned from entering the United States. He spoke after 14 people died in a shooting spree in California by two Muslims whom the FBI said had been radicalised. \n \n His comments prompted more than half a million Britons to sign a petition calling for him to be barred from entering the country, where he has business interests. \n \n The three-hour debate saw lawmakers from all sides criticise Trump\u2019s comments. While it was not followed by a vote, many more lawmakers spoke against a ban than for it. \n \n \u201cI want to see Donald Trump come to this country ... I want him to get a sense of the fury and the frustration with his xenophobic remarks,\u201d said Gavin Robinson, a lawmaker from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party. \n \n Only interior minister Theresa May can issue an order banning entry into Britain and Prime Minister David Cameron has said while Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cdivisive, unhelpful and wrong\u201d, he does not back the idea of barring him. \n \n Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said the government did not comment on who it was considering for exclusion but said \u201ca frank and open exchange of views\u201d was the most effective way to influence Trump. \n \n \u201cThe U.S. remains our most important bilateral partner. It is in the UK\u2019s interests that we engage all presidential candidates, Democratic and Republican, even though we may disagree profoundly on important issues,\u201d he said. \n \n \u2018NOT WITHIN 1,000 MILES\u2019 \n \n \u201cI believe it is for the American people to hold him to account. It is bad politics ... to intervene in the electoral processes of other countries,\u201d said Conservative lawmaker Tom Tugendhat. \n \n Some spoke passionately in favour of banning Trump however, saying he should not be treated differently from others who have been banned for similar views. \n \n \u201cJust think what would happen in the current climate if he came ... and preached that message of divisive hate,\u201d said Jack Dromey, an opposition Labour Party spokesman on home affairs. \n \n Slideshow (3 Images) \n \n \u201cTo have someone come to our shores who demonises all of the Muslim community would be fundamentally wrong and would undermine the safety and security of our citizens and that is not a risk I am prepared to take ... I don\u2019t think Donald Trump should be allowed within a 1,000 miles of our shore.\u201d \n \n Trump has threatened to cancel over 700 million pounds of planned investments in golf courses in Scotland if he is banned. \n \n Trump International Golf Links in Scotland said in a statement: \u201cIt is absurd that valuable parliamentary time is being wasted debating a matter raised as part of the American presidential election.\u201d ||||| MPs are to debate calls for the US presidential candidate Donald Trump to be banned from the UK following his controversial comments about Muslims, after more than half a million people signed a petition. \n \n \n \n The government signalled last month that it would not refuse Trump entry after he was widely criticised for saying that Muslims should be banned from entering the US. \n \n However, the call for the sanction to be imposed on the businessman will now at least have a hearing in parliament after the House of Commons petitions committee announced on Tuesday that it was scheduling a session in Westminster Hall on 18 January. \n \n More than 560,000 people have signed the petition demanding the billionaire businessman be barred. Politicians will also discuss a separate petition opposing such a ban, even though it only gained about 40,000 signatures \u2013 well below the 100,000 threshold for triggering a debate. \n \n Trump, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination in the US, faced an international backlash last month after urging a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on\u201d. \n \n Woman behind petition to ban Donald Trump from UK \u2018shocked\u2019 by support Read more \n \n Justifying his comments, he claimed there were \u201cplaces in London and other places that are so radicalised that police are afraid for their own lives\u201d. There was no immediate response on Tuesday from Trump or his campaign to the news that the debate was to go ahead. \n \n The prime minister, David Cameron, has condemned the remarks as \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong\u201d but made clear he did not support banning Trump. \n \n The debate later this month will be led by the Labour MP Paul Flynn, a member of the committee. Its chairwoman, Helen Jones, said: \u201cBy scheduling a debate on these petitions, the committee is not expressing a view on whether or not the government should exclude Donald Trump from the UK. As with any decision to schedule a petition for debate, it simply means that the committee has decided that the subject should be debated. A debate will allow a range of views to be expressed.\u201d ||||| For good reasons the Government does not routinely comment on individual immigration and exclusion decisions. \n \n The Home Secretary may exclude a non-European Economic Area national from the UK if she considers their presence in the UK to be non-conducive to the public good. \n \n The Home Secretary has said that coming to the UK is a privilege and not a right and she will continue to use the powers available to prevent from entering the UK those who seek to harm our society and who do not share our basic values. \n \n Exclusion powers are very serious and are not used lightly. The Home Secretary will use these powers when justified and based on all available evidence. \n \n The Prime Minister has made clear that he completely disagrees with Donald Trump\u2019s remarks. The Home Secretary has said that Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in relation to Muslims are divisive, unhelpful and wrong. \n \n \n \n The Government recognises the strength of feeling against the remarks and will continue to speak out against comments which have the potential to divide our communities, regardless of who makes them. We reject any attempts to create division and marginalisation amongst those we endeavour to protect. \n \n Home Office ||||| Image copyright Getty Images \n \n British MPs are set to debate a petition later (16:30 GMT) calling for a ban on Donald Trump from entering the country. You'll be able to follow the debate in video and text here. \n \n Who is Donald Trump? \n \n A billionaire New York property mogul and former star of the US Apprentice who is the surprise front runner in the race to be the next Republican candidate for the White House. \n \n He seems to have made a lot of Brits angry \n \n More than 570,000 people have signed an online petition calling for Donald J Trump to be banned from the UK, more than enough to trigger a debate in Parliament. \n \n Controversial comments \n \n Trump's supporters love his straight-talking style. The more taboos he breaks the higher he seems to go in the polls. He sparked outrage at the start of his campaign by branding Mexicans \"criminals\" and \"rapists\". He has also come in for flak from his opponents over comments about a female Fox News presenter and a disabled reporter. \n \n The final straw \n \n The UK petition was launched after Trump called for a ban on all Muslims entering the US until the authorities \"can figure out\" their attitudes. He also claimed London had become \"so radicalised\" the city's police force are \"afraid for their own lives\" and there are \"no-go zones\". \n \n Could Trump actually be banned from the UK? \n \n Image copyright PA \n \n Home Secretary Theresa May can - and does - prevent people from entering the UK because of things they have said. The Home Office says she does not use these powers lightly, only \"if she considers their presence in the UK to be non-conducive to the public good\" or if they are people who \"seek to harm our society and who do not share our basic values\". \n \n Who's on Britain's blacklist? \n \n Image copyright Getty Images \n \n Florida pastor Terry Jones, pictured, who gained notoriety for trying to organise a Koran-burning protest, white supremacist Don Black and Safwat Hegazy, a controversial Egyptian preacher, are among those to have been barred from Britain in recent years. \n \n What about politicians? \n \n Image copyright Getty Images \n \n Dutch MP Geert Wilders, pictured, who called the Koran a \"fascist book\" was banned from entering the UK in 2009 on security grounds. He overturned the ban on appeal and flew into Heathrow in a blaze of publicity. \n \n What Cameron thinks \n \n Image copyright AP \n \n In a rare intervention in US politics, Prime Minister David Cameron labelled Trump's comments \"stupid and wrong\" but said he did not support a ban, saying the tycoon would \"unite us all against him\" if he visited the UK. \n \n Could Monday's debate change Cameron's mind? \n \n Image caption MPs take part in an earlier Westminster Hall debate \n \n It's unlikely. The three-hour debate is not taking place in the Commons chamber - the place where British laws are made - but in a side chamber, Westminster Hall, and there will not be a vote at the end of it. \n \n A ban would be 'counterproductive' \n \n Paul Flynn, pictured, the veteran Labour MP who is proposing Monday's motion, says he does not want to see Trump banned from the UK as it would hand the Republican candidate a publicity coup. More than 40,000 people have signed a counter-petition, arguing that it would be \"totally illogical\" to ban Trump, which will also be debated by the MPs. \n \n \"Let me take you by the hand...\" \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Brixton, in south London, would be on Flynn's itinerary \n \n Taking his cue from the folk song Streets of London, Paul Flynn says he would like to take Mr Trump by the hand and show him what Britain is like. He told BBC News: \"I would invite him to show me where the no-go areas are in Britain and have a discussion about why in the UK we have fewer gun shot deaths per year than America has per day. Perhaps we can have a stroll down to Brixton to have a look at the racial harmony there.\" \n \n British lefties lecturing the Americans \n \n \"If we are seen as a group of left-wingers opposing Trump it could have the reverse effect to the one the petitioners want,\" says Flynn. He says he wants to avoid interfering in US politics and will stress that country's proud tradition of free speech. \n \n So what's the point of the debate? \n \n Paul Flynn says he wants to give a voice to the petitioners' anger. There will be MPs who disagree with Mr Flynn, insisting a ban is necessary, and possibly some who will support his views. \n \n Salmond v Trump \n \n Image copyright Reuters \n \n The big question for many on Monday, is will Alex Salmond put in an appearance? The former SNP leader has had a long-running spat with Trump, who recently called him \"an embarrassment to Scotland\". Trump is proud of his Scottish ancestry but his investments in Aberdeenshire and ownership of the Turnberry golf resort have created controversy. \n \n He was stripped of his status as a business ambassador for Scotland by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon after his Muslim comments. \n \n Speaking on Sunday, Mr Salmond said he personally backed a ban, telling the BBC: \"My view is that, yes, I would probably ban \"The Donald\" because it would do him some good. He wants to ban all Muslims from the US. I want to ban all Donald Trumps from Scotland.\" \n \n Image copyright AFP \n \n The last word? \n \n MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh will be speaking for the Scottish National Party in Monday's debate. But don't bet against Salmond having a say also.",

His views, while not constituting a declaration... ||||| Fight against terrorist group on course for Obama to stop using legal authority given by Congress to wage war, says lawyer \n \n The US is heading for a \"tipping point\" beyond which it should no longer pursue al-Qaida terrorists by military means, one of the Obama administration's most senior lawyers has said. \n \n Jeh Johnson suggested the group would become so degraded that a time would come when the legal authority given to the White House by Congress should no longer be used to justify waging the war that has been fought since 2001. \n \n Johnson said that when this happened, America had to \"be able to say ... that our efforts should no longer be considered an armed conflict against al-Qaida and its affiliates\". \n \n Instead, the responsibility for tackling al-Qaida should pass to the police and other law enforcement agencies. \n \n Johnson has been general counsel at the US defence department for the past four years and has given advice on every military operation that needs the approval of the president or defence secretary. \n \n In a speech presented tonight in the UK, Johnson was expected to set out the legal principles underpinning the conflict against al-Qaida and insisted they were rooted in domestic and international law. Congress had authorised the president to use \"all necessary and appropriate force\" against the nations, organisations and individuals responsible for the 9/11 attacks; the US supreme court had endorsed this in 2006 by ruling \"our efforts against al-Qaida may be properly viewed as armed conflict\". \n \n But Johnson also made clear these principles were not open-ended, and that the US government would need to respond when circumstances change. And though he said he could not predict when the conflict would draw to a close, he said the US must not be afraid to change its tactics. \n \n \"I do believe that on the present course there will come a tipping point, a tipping point at which so many of the leaders and operatives of al-Qaida and its affiliates have been killed or captured, and the group is no longer able to attempt or launch a strategic attack against the United States, such that al-Qaida as we know it, the organisation that our Congress authorised the military to pursue in 2001, has been effectively destroyed. \n \n \"At that point we must be able to say to ourselves that our efforts should no longer be considered an armed conflict against al-Qaida and its associated forces, rather a counter-terrorism effort against individuals who are the scattered remains of al-Qaida \u2026 for which the law enforcement and intelligence resources of our government are principally responsible.\" America's military assets would then be available in reserve, he said. \n \n The US could not \"capture or kill every last terrorist who claims an affiliation with al-Qaida\" and the enemy \"did not include anyone solely in the category of activist, journalist, or propagandist\". \n \n Washington's pursuit of suspected al-Qaida terrorists has been controversial, such as the use of UAVs \u2013 or drones \u2013 to launch attacks in countries such as Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. \n \n The administration has been criticised by human rights groups and US academics who say the tactic enrages local populations and causes civilian deaths. It is also legally dubious, they argue. \n \n A fortnight ago the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, claimed America had \"decimated core al-Qaida\" and that the group was \"widely distributed, loosely knit and geographically dispersed\". \n \n His remarks echoed those of Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, who is Barack Obama's nominee to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. \n \n She has been pilloried by Republicans for suggesting the attack in Benghazi, Libya, that led to the death of US ambassador Christopher Stephen was spontaneous rather than planned. \n \n Such characterisations will put Washington under greater pressure to review and justify the military campaign against al-Qaida, which has been virtually wiped out in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and now exists only in small, disorganised regional splinter groups. \n \n Speaking at the Oxford Union, Johnson insisted the US was applying conventional law to an unconventional enemy, and justified detaining prisoners indefinitely and using \"targeted lethal force\" \u2013 such as drones \u2013 to kill suspects. He conceded these techniques would be questionable \"viewed in the context of law enforcement or criminal justice, where no person is sentenced to death or prison without an indictment, an arraignment, and a trial before an impartial judge and jury\". \n \n But, he added: \"Viewed within the context of conventional armed conflict, as they should be, capture, detention and lethal force are traditional practices as old as armies. Capture and detention by the military are part and parcel of armed conflict. We employ weapons of war against al-Qaida but in a manner consistent with the rule of law. We employ lethal force, but in a manner consistent with the law of war principles of proportionality, necessity and distinction.\" \n \n Johnson said that when the military conflict came to an end, those still in detention would not necessarily be released immediately. He said that after the end of the second world war, the US and British governments delayed the release of some Nazi prisoners of war. \n \n \"We refuse to allow this enemy, with its contemptible tactics, to define the way in which we wage war,\" he said. \"Our efforts remain grounded in the rule of law.\"",

They estimate that taxing marijuana will bring in millions of dollars of new revenue for governments, and will save court systems and police departments additional millions. \n \n Opponents warned that the law \u2014 despite its 21-year age minimum \u2014 would set Colorado and Washington on a collision course with the federal government and encourage teenagers to use marijuana. \n \n It is still unclear how much will change. The streets here in Denver and across Colorado are already lined with shops, their windows decorated with green crosses and pot leaves, advertising all-natural plant treatments and herbal health aids. \n \n \u201cColoradans are accustomed to having this stuff above ground, supervised by state authorities and having it regulated,\u201d said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, which supported legalization. \n \n To advocates, the real power of the measures\u2019 passage may be that they signal a change in the way voters think about drugs and drug policy in the United States. \n \n Brian Vicente, a leading campaigner for the Colorado initiative, summed it up this way: \u201cIt\u2019s a historic one, man.\u201d ||||| DENVER\u2014Now that measures legalizing some recreational marijuana for adults use have won approval in Colorado and Washington, state regulators and lawmakers must decide how to navigate federal opposition as they implement voters' desires. \n \n The measures flout federal law, under which marijuana sales and possession remain illegal.

John Hickenlooper said he is trying to speak soon with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to learn how the Justice Department will respond to the legalization measure\u2019s passage. \n \n Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said, despite his opposition to legalization, he would work with the state legislature to implement the new law \u2014 which he doubted the federal government would allow to stand. Proponents of Amendment 64, the measure voters approved with nearly 55 percent support on Tuesday, said they were optimistic the federal government would \u201crespect the will of Colorado voters.\u201d \n \n And the Colorado U.S. attorney \u2014 the top federal prosecutor in the state \u2014 remained largely mum on how the conflict would play out. In a statement, local U.S. attorney\u2019s office spokesman Jeff Dorschner reiterated that the Justice Department\u2019s intent to enforce the federal law that makes all marijuana possession or sales a crime \u201cremains unchanged.\u201d \n \n \u201cMy sense is that it is unlikely the federal government is going to allow states one by one to unilaterally decriminalize marijuana,\u201d Hickenlooper said, adding, though, \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with the will of the voters.\u201d \n \n What lies ahead for Colorado \u2014 after it and Washington on Tuesday became the first states in the nation to buck federal law by legalizing marijuana for any purpose \u2014 is largely unknown territory. No state since the beginning of marijuana prohibition has rolled back restrictions on cannabis to the extent Colorado now has. \n \n Amendment 64 allows people 21 and older to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants in their homes. The law won\u2019t take effect, though, until Hickenlooper issues a proclamation certifying the vote. That will likely take at least a month. By law, it doesn\u2019t have to happen until Jan. 5. \n \n Until then, all non-medical marijuana possession and cultivation in Colorado remain a crime. In other words, at least for a few more weeks, the time to puff has not yet come to pass. \n \n Amendment 64 also creates a system in which marijuana could be sold at specially regulated retail stores \u2014 which would be separate from medical-marijuana dispensaries. The details of that system must still be worked out by the state legislature and the Department of Revenue. The first recreational marijuana stores would likely not open until 2014, said Brian Vicente, one of Amendment 64\u2019s proponents. \n \n Before that happens, the federal government might choose to intervene by, among other options, filing a lawsuit arguing that the law\u2019s retail sales section violates the U.S. Constitution because it frustrates federal drug laws. \n \n \u201cColoradans should not expect to see successful legal challenges to the ability of the federal government to enforce its marijuana laws in Colorado,\u201d Suthers wrote in a statement. \u201cAccordingly, I call upon the United States Department of Justice to make known its intentions regarding prosecution of activities sanctioned by Amendment 64.\u201d \n \n The measure\u2019s supporters said they are optimistic the federal government will allow the law to stand, and they heralded their victory Tuesday as the first step in a nationwide push to end marijuana prohibition. \n \n \u201cThings are moving,\u201d Mason Tvert, one of the campaign\u2019s chief proponents, said. \u201cThey\u2019re moving quickly. We think the writing is on the wall.\u201d \n \n Amendment 64 \u2014 which polls showed hovering at around 50 percent support heading into Election Day \u2014 won with what even supporters said was a surprising amount of cushion. With roughly 1.28 million votes in its favor, it drew more support than President Barack Obama did in winning Colorado. \n \n It passed in more counties than it lost \u2014 33 to 31. It won in seven counties that voted for Republican Mitt Romney and lost in only one \u2014 Conejos \u2014 that voted for Obama. \n \n \u201cWe are at the tipping point on marijuana policy,\u201d Vicente said. \u201cThis is an area where our voters and our citizens are really leading.\u201d \n \n Drug-abuse prevention professionals, though, said Wednesday that Colorado is going down a dangerous path. They predicted marijuana legalization would increase pot use, especially among young people, and lead to higher rates of drugged driving and substance abuse. \n \n \u201cWe need to let people know it is not OK for youths to use marijuana,\u201d said Christian Thurstone, a substance-abuse treatment doctor at Denver Health medical center. \u201cWe need them to realize it\u2019s not OK for young people to drive under the influence of marijuana.\u201d \n \n John Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/john_ingold",

Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation has crossed a constitutional... ||||| AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File Special Counsel Robert Mueller departs after a meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n \n Deep State! Witch Hunt! Swamp! NO COLLUSION! Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter harangues against Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election have become so common that we are inured to them. Likewise, the denunciations of Mueller by Rudy Giuliani, Devin Nunes, and Sean Hannity can generally be ignored, even when they deliver them in lower-case letters. But when a noted scholar of constitutional law raises similar, though far more rational, arguments, attention must be paid. \n \n Steven Calabresi is chairman of the board of the Federalist Society and the Clayton J. and Henry R. Barber Professor of Law at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law\u2014and, we should add, a friend and colleague of ours.He recently published an op-ed in The Hill, purporting to explain why President Trump has behaved lawfully by demanding a Justice Department investigation of so-called FBI spying, and why Mueller\u2019s own investigation is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d He is half right, but it is the lesser half. \n \n Calabresi writes: \n \n Many liberals and critics are under the mistaken belief that President Trump is violating the rule of law and civil liberties ... by ordering the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General to investigate whether or not the FBI spied on his 2016 presidential campaign. In fact, the president is behaving totally lawfully. \n \n This is sleight of hand. Perhaps we missed it, but we know of no serious critic who claims that Trump lacks the legal authority to give orders to the Department of Justice. Rather, the criticism is that he has disregarded the long-standing convention of DOJ independence. A presidential order can be completely lawful in a formal sense, while still endangering \u201cthe rule of law and civil liberties.\u201d Calabresi\u2019s observation about Trump\u2019s power is therefore accurate, but nonetheless a non-sequitur. \n \n Calabresi\u2019s second point, however, is just wrong. He argues that Mueller\u2019s investigation is unconstitutional because he was \u201cnever nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\u201d He reaches this conclusion by claiming that Mueller is \u201cacting like a U.S. attorney\u201d rather than an assistant and is therefore \u201ca principal officer\u201d who must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. But \u201cacting like\u201d a principal officer has no constitutional meaning and, in any case, Calabresi\u2019s only support for this position is that Mueller \u201cis more powerful and famous than are any of the 96 U.S. attorneys.\u201d The factual claim regarding power is dubious, especially in light of Mueller\u2019s referral of the Cohen investigation to the Southern District of New York. Moreover, there is no requirement that prosecutors who conduct national investigations be less \u201cpowerful\u201d than individual U.S. attorneys. Fame, needless to say, is constitutionally irrelevant. \n \n Calabresi makes his point at somewhat greater length in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, in which he cites Justice Rehnquist\u2019s majority opinion in Morrison v. Olson. That case, however, upheld the authority of a special counsel who had much broader powers than Mueller\u2019s. Calabresi quotes Rehnquist as writing \u201cthat independent counsel Alexia Morrison qualified as an \u2018inferior officer,\u2019 not subject to the appointment process, because her office was \u2018limited in jurisdiction\u2019 to \u2018certain federal officials suspected of certain serious federal crimes.\u2019\u201d \n \n Mueller is different, according to Calabresi, because he \u201cis investigating a large number of people and has already charged defendants with many different kinds of crimes.\u201d As it happens, that is an apt description of many investigations under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which was upheld 8-1 by the Rehnquist Court in Morrison. It is axiomatic that a prosecutor does not need to ignore crimes that are discovered in the course of a valid investigation. And of course, Mueller\u2019s subsequent conduct, even if it has been too expansive, would not retroactively invalidate his initial appointment. The very most that can be said, therefore, is that some of Mueller\u2019s indictments might be vulnerable to challenge, but not that his very position violates the Constitution. \n \n Calabresi\u2019s reading of the Constitution\u2019s text is strained and unprecedented. Moreover, text is not the only source of constitutional meaning. In Calabresi\u2019s own leading work on constitutional theory, he writes that \u201ca foundational principle of law is that to some degree what the law is on the books is determined by what it actually is in practice.\u201d (The Unitary Executive, p. 5.) There have been special prosecutors, not confirmed by the Senate, since 1875. They have repeatedly exposed corruption in the executive branch, most notably Richard Nixon\u2019s conspiracy to obstruct justice. The institution is part of the reason for the success of the American regime. A proposal to radically weaken it is far from \u201cconservative.\u201d It is just what Edmund Burke hated about the French Revolution: Calabresi proposes to tear down well-functioning traditions on the basis of an abstract and untested theory. \n \n Finally, Calabresi asserts that \u201cwhen an official uses government power in an unconstitutional way, anything that results from it is subject to the exclusionary rule and is not admissible in court,\u201d evidently invalidating virtually all of Mueller\u2019s work, including his referral of Cohen to the SDNY, as the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d This far exceeds any existing interpretation of the various exclusionary rules, which have been repeatedly narrowed by the Rehnquist and Roberts courts. In any event, an overly expansive investigation by Mueller would still be within the authority of the DOJ, and therefore not unconstitutional. \n \n We are always enlightened by Steven Calabresi\u2019s scholarly work, which we very much admire. But he is wrong about the Mueller investigation. ||||| Replying to @realDonaldTrump Which Democrats are those?

History will remember the damage the trumps have done to America. #Mudd ||||| Trump: 'I have the absolute right to pardon myself' 8:40 AM ET Tue, 5 June 2018 | 01:00 \n \n President Donald Trump said Monday he has \"the absolute right\" to pardon himself \u2014 but added that he has \"done nothing wrong.\" \n \n The tweet followed The New York Times' publication of a confidential letter over the weekend, in which Trump's lawyers argued to special counsel Robert Mueller that the president's broad powers mean he could not have obstructed justice. \n \n The 20-page letter also suggested that the president even wields the constitutional ability to exercise the pardon power in matters related to the special counsel's probe of the links between the Trump campaign and Russia. \n \n The assertion that a U.S. president holds an \"absolute\" power to pardon himself was endorsed on Sunday by Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and a current member of Trump's legal team. \n \n Read more: Trump lays out two rationales for pardoning himself in the Mueller probe \n \n In an ABC News interview, Giuliani said Trump \"probably does\" have the power to pardon himself, though \"he has no intention\" of doing so. \n \n In word and action, Trump's latest uses of the pardon power could hold implications for how the president plans to act as the Russia probe, and the numerous lawsuits it has spawned, move forward. \n \n Trump exercised his power to pardon last week for a sixth time, for conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, who was convicted of making an illegal campaign contribution. In a tweet, Trump said D'Souza \"was treated very unfairly by our government!\" \n \n Later that day, Trump told reporters he was considering pardoning celebrity lifestyle guru Martha Stewart and was considering commuting the sentence of ex-Gov. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois. He said both also had been treated \"unfairly.\" \n \n Stewart was convicted in 2004 and sentenced to five months for a conviction related to a stock-selling scheme. Blagojevich, a Democrat, was sentenced in 2011 to 14 years in prison on corruption convictions, including trying to trade the Senate seat that became vacant when President Barack Obama went to the White House. Stewart and Blagojevich had ties to Trump's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" reality TV show. \n \n But Trump's latest tweets suggest he may be considering pardons for the very people who could be offering information about him to federal investigators. \n \n In just over a year, the special counsel has issued more than a dozen indictments, against Russians accused of working to affect the 2016 election as well as former Trump campaign officials, such as former campaign chief Paul Manafort. \n \n Mueller's team has also secured guilty pleas from Trump's first national security advisor, Michael Flynn, and Manafort's longtime associate, Rick Gates, among others. Both men have agreed to fully cooperate with the probe. \n \n No president has ever pardoned themselves. But a Justice Department memorandum from 1974 \u2014 shortly before the resignation of President Richard Nixon \u2014 asserted that the president did not possess such a power. \n \n \"Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself,\" Mary Lawton, former acting assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, said in the memorandum. \n \n Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who runs a commutations clinic at the University of St. Thomas, said the most controversial legal question is not the pardon itself, but what comes after. \n \n \"He can issue himself a pardon warrant. There is nothing to stop him from doing so,\" Osler said. \"The question is what happens next. It could be that it could not be challenged until a prosecutor presented a charge against him, and he relied on the pardon as a defense.\" \n \n Trump attacked the legal legitimacy of the special counsel in a follow-up tweet. Mueller's team, which was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May 2017, is \"totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL,\" Trump said. \n \n The president maintained in both tweets that he has done \"nothing wrong.\" \n \n Numerous Trump campaign associates and other individuals have been interviewed as part of Mueller's investigation. While Trump has previously said he would like to participate in an interview, the letter argues that the special counsel must meet a high standard to prove that only the president himself could provide the information they seek. \n \n The special counsel is also looking into whether an obstruction of justice occurred as part of the investigations into Russian meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. \n \n But Trump's lawyers contend in the letter that the commander in chief \"could neither constitutionally nor legally constitute obstruction because that would amount to him obstructing himself, and that he could, if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired.\" \n \n A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment on Trump's tweets. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. \n \n --CNBC's Tucker Higgins contributed to this report.",

Abdulla Hazim Stanikzai, the provincial police chief. \n \n There were no NATO casualties. The Taliban insurgency said the attack was in retaliation for the Quran burning and said it hoped the attacks will continue \"with the anger of the public.\" \n \n Another attack of \"some significance\" was reported later Monday in Naranghar province, near the Pakistani border, said Lt. Cmdr. James Williams, an ISAF spokesman. \n \n A statement from the Taliban said its fighters also attacked U.S. troops and border police in southern Naranghar on Monday evening, claiming to have inflicted a dozen deaths on the U.S. and Afghan force while losing five of their own. But Williams said that while some insurgent casualties had been reported, there were no deaths among allied troops. \n \n The Qurans that were burned were among religious materials seized from a detainee facility at Bagram Airfield last week. U.S. President Barack Obama apologized to Karzai last week, calling the burning an inadvertent error. \n \n In a statement issued on the bombing Monday, Karzai condemned the \"inhuman and un-Islamic\" act and urged that \"the ruthless enemy would earn nothing but growing public hatred and punishment before Allah, the Almighty.\" \n \n JUST WATCHED 9 killed by suicide bomb in Afghanistan Replay More Videos ...

John Allen, commander of NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said insurgents tried to attack the ISAF installation and failed, instead taking more innocent lives. \n \n The Taliban also claimed Monday to be behind the poisoning of food at a dining facility at Forward Operating Base Torkham, near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It too was a retaliatory attack, the group said. \n \n ISAF confirmed that food at the base appeared to have been contaminated over the weekend, though it was unclear whether it was deliberate. \n \n \"Nobody got sick. A dining facility worker came to his leaders at the FOB and said that something had been poisoned,\" said Maj. David Eastburn, an ISAF spokesman. \n \n \"The dining facility was shut down, and we brought in environmental health, who found traces of chlorine bleach in the coffee and fruit. Soldiers are now eating pre-prepared rations, and no one was affected. There is a full investigation that is narrowing down who was responsible.\" \n \n Capt. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman in Kabul, said it's not clear whether the incident was a deliberate attempt to poison troops or \"was just inadvertent, perhaps using more Clorox in the cleaning process than they should have.\" \n \n The Taliban has frequently exaggerated its claims or claimed responsibility for attacks that later turned out to be the work of another group. \n \n Even so, Monday's bombing and news of the contaminated food come on the heels of a week of violent protests over the Quran burning. The violence has left at least 39 people dead, including four American soldiers, and hundreds more wounded. \n \n In northern Kunduz province over the weekend, protesters attacked a police chief's office and a U.S. military base, authorities said. Some threw hand grenades at the base, known as Combat Outpost Fortitude, with resulting blasts wounding seven U.S. personnel believed to be Special Forces members, they said. \n \n Demonstrations outside the United Nations office in Kunduz on Saturday left four civilians dead and prompted the U.N. mission there to say Monday that it is temporarily relocating its international staff. \n \n Two U.S. soldiers were gunned down last week at a base in eastern Afghanistan by a man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform. \n \n Allen pulled military advisers from Afghan ministries after Saturday's shooting deaths of two other U.S. officers inside the heavily secure Ministry of Interior. Authorities are searching for the suspect, identified by Afghan police as a junior officer in the ministry's intelligence department. \n \n The suspect had been fired by the Interior Ministry but rejoined the intelligence services as a driver a couple of months ago, a senior Afghan counterterrorism official said Monday. \n \n \"We do not know how he was allowed into the office, as the command and control center requires a password for access,\" said the official, who is not authorized to speak to the media about the topic. \"There is something fishy there.\" \n \n The official said he believed that the gunman used a silencer on his weapon, as no one heard the gunshots. He said he doubts that an angry exchange led to the shooting, because the \"way he entered was not accidental.\" \n \n Kirby said it's not clear whether the shooting was linked the the Quran burning. \n \n \"We don't know what the motivation was behind the murders, and we don't know all the facts surrounding how this individual got into this space and frankly was able to get out as quickly and apparently as easily as he did,\" Kirby said Monday. \n \n Allen has told his commanders he will not authorize the return of personnel to Afghan ministries until new security measures are in place and working, according to an official who has access to the latest intelligence and is involved in administration discussions but declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the situation. \n \n The religious materials, including Qurans, were removed from a detainee center library at Bagram Airfield because they had \"extremist inscriptions\" on them and there was \"an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications,\" a military official said. \n \n The ensuing attacks have put pressure on already strained U.S.-Afghan relations at a time when the United States is working to reduce troop levels and transition security as part of its plan to withdraw by 2014. \n \n Pentagon officials on Monday acknowledged the significance of the attacks but denied they are affecting the U.S. or NATO mission there. \n \n \"These events, they're troubling. They're worrisome. They've gotten everybody's attention,\" Kirby said. \"Yes, tension is high here in Kabul right now, but across the country at large, the mission continues, and we're seeing the protest activity decline.\" \n \n The number of protests in Afghanistan has gone from 24 on Saturday to three on Monday, only two of which were because of the Quran burning, Kirby said. ||||| A suicide car bomber has struck at the gates of Jalalabad airport in eastern Afghanistan, officials said, killing nine people in an attack insurgents said was revenge for U.S. troops burning Qurans. \n \n The early Monday explosion comes after six days of deadly protests in Afghanistan over the disposal of Qurans and other Islamic texts in a burn pit last week at a U.S. military base north of the capital. \n \n American officials have called the incident a mistake and issued a series of apologies. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has urged calm, saying that Afghans should not let the insurgents capitalize on their indignation to spark violence. \n \n Monday's attack appeared to be a sign that the Taliban are seizing the opportunity to do just that. \n \n The bomber drove up to the gates of the airport _ which serves both civilian and international military aircraft _ shortly after dawn and detonated his explosives in a \"very strong\" blast, said Nangarhar provincial police spokesman Hazrad Mohammad. \n \n Among the dead were six civilians, two airport guards and one soldier, Mohammad said. Another six people were wounded, he said. \n \n An AP photographer saw at least four destroyed cars at the gates of the airport. \n \n NATO forces spokesman Capt. Justin Brockhoff said that no international forces were killed in the early morning attack and that the installation was not breached by the blast. \n \n The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying a suicide car bomber had driven up to the airport gate and detonated his explosives as international forces were changing from night to morning guard duty. \n \n \"This attack is revenge against those soldiers who burned our Quran,\" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in an email. \n \n More than 30 people have been killed in protests and related attacks since the incident came to light this past Tuesday, including four U.S. soldiers. \n \n On Sunday, demonstrators hurled grenades at a small U.S. base in northern Afghanistan and the ensuing gun battle left two Afghans dead and seven NATO troops injured. \n \n Still, the top U.S. diplomat in Afghanistan said Sunday that the violence would not change Washington's course. \n \n \"Tensions are running very high here, and I think we need to let things calm down, return to a more normal atmosphere, and then get on with business,\" Ambassador Ryan Crocker told CNN. \n \n In the most high-profile attack, two military advisers were found dead in their office at the Interior Ministry in the heart of the capital with shots to the back of their heads. The slayings inside one of the city's most heavily guarded buildings raised doubts about safety as coalition troops continue their withdrawal. \n \n The incident prompted NATO, Britain and France to recall hundreds of international advisers from all Afghan ministries in the capital. The advisers are key to helping improve governance and preparing the country's security forces to take on more responsibility. \n \n A manhunt was under way for the main suspect in the shooting _ an Afghan man who worked as a driver for an office on the same floor as the advisers who were killed, Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi said. He did not provide further details about the suspect or his possible motive. \n \n The Taliban claimed that the shooter was one of their sympathizers and that an accomplice had helped him get into the compound to kill the Americans in retaliation for the Quran burnings.",
