Those fleeing the club probably were alarmed by a strong smell of pepper spray, Cari said.Read MoreFive teens and a woman who had accompanied her daughter to the concert were killed, said Luigi Di Maio, a deputy prime minister. He identified the dead as Asia Nasoni, 14; Daniele Pongetti, 16;  Benedetta Vitali, 15; Mattia Orlandi, 15; Emma Fabini, 14; and Eleonora Girolimini, 39. \"These (victims) are young people. It's absurd to die this way. As a government we will do everything we can to clarify the circumstances and make sure the security norms were followed,\" Di Maio posted on Facebook.Paramedics were seen helping concertgoers on the street following the stampede.  Thirty-five of about 100 people who were treated remained in a hospital Saturday afternoon, including seven whose conditions were life-threatening and another five in serious condition, said Oreste Capocasa, chief of police in Ancona.Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who also is a deputy prime minister, held a moment of silence in honor of the victims during a political rally in Rome. \"You cannot die like this at 15. Thoughts and prayers for the six dead tonight in Marche. I hope (those) who are seriously injured in the hospital get well. And a commitment: find the responsible,\" Salvini tweeted hours after the stampede.Italian President Sergio Mattarella promised to work tirelessly to determine \"any responsibility and negligence.\"\"Citizens have the right to feel safe everywhere, in workplaces and in leisure areas. Therefore, safety must be assured with particular care in crowded meeting places, through rigorous controls,\" Mattarella said in a statement. \"No one should die this way.\"  Sfera Ebbasta, in a post on Instagram, said he was deeply saddened by what happened.\"It's difficult to find the words to express the regret and sadness of these tragedies,\" the rapper wrote in Italian, according to a CNN translation.  He said he would cancel his promotional events over the coming days out of respect for the dead and injured.Corinaldo is 145 kilometers (about 90 miles) east of Florence.CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.",

A German university is soliciting submissions for just that, and three people will be awarded a $1,900 stipend.On Wednesday, The University of Fine Arts in Hamburg announced a call for applications for their \"Scholarships for Doing Nothing,\" between now and September 15. \"The world we are living in is driven by the belief in success, in growth, in money. This thinking was leading us into the ecological crisis -- and social injustice -- we are living in. We wanted to turn that upside down -- giving a grant not for the 'best' and for 'doing a project,' but for doing nothing,\" said Friedrich von Borries, a professor of design theory at the university and creator of the scholarship project.Von Borries told CNN that applicants from all over the world and all walks of life are welcome to present their ideas. The submission questionnaire asks applicants to think about an activity they do not want to do, how long they don't want to do it for, why it is important to not do the specific thing in question, and why they are the right person not to do it.Read MoreThe idea is that refraining from doing something may actually benefit others, who would otherwise be impacted by the negative consequences of our actions.\"We played with the term 'doing nothing' but we are meaning, to be more precise, 'not doing something anymore,'\" von Borries said, speaking about the conscious decision to pursue \"active inactivity.\"All applications will be anonymously featured in an upcoming exhibition at Hamburg's Museum of Art and Design called \"The School of Inconsequentiality: Exercises for a Different Life,\" focused on the idea of sustainability. Three cash prize winners will be announced at the opening of the exhibition on November 5, and winners will be required to produce a report about their experience to be featured at the exhibit. The report is not intended as a tool for accountability, but rather it should offer insights about how the winners fared in trying to refrain from doing something. \"I think that doing nothing is not that easy. You can fail. Your surroundings can become aggressive ... And we would love to learn from the experience of those who will receive the grant,\" said Von Borries.The call for submissions happens in the context of a pandemic that highlighted the importance of staying home and refraining from some activities for the greater good.\"During Covid, we stopped being busy not only to protect ourselves but to protect others,\" Von Borries said. \"That is something I find very important and I hope we will be able to transfer this attitude into the post-Covid times,\" he added.It's not easy to shift our mindset from being so focused on productivity and success to quite the opposite. Von Borries, who says he also struggles with being \"obsessed with work,\" hopes he too will learn from the applications. \"We all live everyday in contradictions between what we do, what we want to do, and what we know would be better to do. We have to learn to deal with these contradictions, instead of simply denying them,\" he said.You can submit your applications here.",

    "context": " (CNN)Two years ago, Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.  She could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease. \"She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her,\" he told an FDA advisory committee. He believed that a new medication called Nuplazid, made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals, was the answer.  Nuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a \"breakthrough therapy\" -- meaning that it demonstrated \"substantial improvement\" in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process, which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.  Read MoreStill, to recommend approval, the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients. Some FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials, though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.  But the physician who led the FDA's medical review, Dr. Paul Andreason, warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes, including death, at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing, he said, had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks. I remember leaving really, really frustrated\nFDA advisory committee member \nWhile Tyne had heard about these risks, he said he \"discounted death as a real statistical possibility\" and was willing to try anything to help his mother.  \"I have two young children who love their grandmother,\" he told the committee. \"If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy, my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving, funny, caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please, I beg you, do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love.\" 'You have to take it seriously' The committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a six-week study of about 200 patients. Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective, Andreason said in his medical review, though they showed similar risk.    Even some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations, according to the hearing transcript. \"I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small, and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this, I think they're probably willing to take that risk,\" one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a \"plea\" to the FDA to \"consider a large observational study so we can ensure that, once it goes into real-world use, that the benefits will outweigh the risks.\"   It hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it, sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017. Tyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months, he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease, and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. \"She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all,\" he said.   Shortly after the drug's release, patients' family members, doctors and other health care professionals started reporting \"adverse events\" possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths, life-threatening incidents, falls, insomnia, nausea and fatigue. In more than 1,000 reports, patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.Creatures like cats and snakes can haunt patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis, as shown in Acadia's TV commercial.In November, an analysis released by a nonprofit health care organization, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was \"not providing the expected benefit\" or potentially worsening the condition. Tracked by the FDA, these so-called \"adverse event reports\" document deaths, side effects and other issues, and can be made directly by consumers, caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker, which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases, the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others, the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug. An adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label, for instance, or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.    After analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports \"reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good.\" Thomas Moore, senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit, said the deaths are an \"important warning signal\" and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action, depending on what the review finds.Since the institute released its analysis, FDA data shows that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June, Nuplazid was the only medication listed as \"suspect\" in at least 500 of the death reports. This is almost unheard of to have this many deaths reported...you have to take it seriously.\nDiana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research \nPhysicians, medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly, based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths, they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks.\"This is almost unheard of, to have this many deaths reported,\" said Diana Zuckerman, founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research, adding that because reports are voluntary, potential problems may be underreported. \"You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously.\"Acadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease, according to the FDA, and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.   Acadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease, meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus, the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death, which it is required to pass along to the FDA.\"If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers, it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported, especially in an older, chronically ill patient population,\" the company said in a statement.Read Acadia's full response here    It said its \"benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged,\" and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted, for example, that since the drug's approval, two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.  The company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic, professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. \"I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug,\" Jankovic said in the statement. \"While not all patients are completely satisfied, many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations, paranoia and other psychotic symptoms.\" In an interview this week, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available, like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product, he said he is \"familiar with the circumstances\" and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is \"appropriately balancing\" safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard, however, and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.  JUST WATCHEDFDA chief: Opioids are biggest crisis we faceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFDA chief: Opioids are biggest crisis we face 03:54\"You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known,\" he said.The FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's \"complex safety profile,\" recognized at the time of its approval, resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.    The cases reported so far, according to the FDA, typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.    \n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\n\"Based on these data, the FDA has, at this time, not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling,\" the agency said in a statement.   The FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe \"black box\" warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients, after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain, its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so, Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.    Related: The little red pill being pushed on the elderlyGeriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.    To determine the true risks of Nuplazid, the researchers interviewed by CNN said, the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports, which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that, because the drug was already approved, these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.   Hundreds of adverse event reports A CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.   In these reports, the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases, it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others, family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.  This is exactly what I thought I was going to happen.Dr. Paul Andreason, who led the FDA medical review of Nuplazid One report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning, a nurse noted that the woman was \"sleepy.\" Shortly after, she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and, less than an hour after the nurse's visit, she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was \"related\" to Nuplazid, her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.    Related: Sick, dying and raped in America's nursing homesIn another report, an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report, a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away, she said, she was told by \"someone at the hospital\" that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.      Acadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there \"is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid.\" Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid, which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug, along with Medicare claims data. However, multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.   Widening the patient pool In the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths, Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock, some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.   Currently, Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day, according to wholesale pricing data from First Databank. That can add up to more than $30,000 a year for a single patient, though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.   Acadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.    Acadia's TV commercial shows how frightening Parkinson's disease psychosis can be.The company, meanwhile, is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October, the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well, meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process. While a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason, insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population, concerned medical experts told CNN.    \"You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else,\" said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research, based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. \"If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much, much larger -- that would be unconscionable.    \"That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk.\"    'I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up' Roughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting, where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.Andreason, the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid, no longer works for the agency. He said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time, he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that, when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's, physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.  He said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.   Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up.\nSon of Parkinson's patient \n\"This is exactly what I thought was going to happen,\" he said. \"We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths.\"  Dr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings, a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting, recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are, but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that, after previous studies didn't show it was effective, the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured, which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used \"consistent, appropriate, and validated assessment methodology.\"\"If patients know there is some level of benefit, they can judge their risk,\" said Fox-Rawlings. \"But if we don't even know that it does work, how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope.\"    Kim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.  \"I remember leaving really, really frustrated,\" she said.    CNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting, despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials, to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.   One of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the \"staggering cost\" of the medication, she said, she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months, he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories, however, and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.  The other person was Tyne. The 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid, but he still gets frustrated talking about it.   \"Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up,\" he said.  But he doesn't regret trying.    \"If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it, I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror.\" Do you have information to share about Nuplazid or other drugs targeting the elderly?

And at Wilson's unveiling as a Broncos player on Wednesday, first-year head coach Nathaniel Hackett couldn't contain his excitement at having a Super Bowl champion as his quarterback. \"Wow! C'mon, y'all. Russell Wilson! Holy sh*t. Very exciting,\" he said with a smile. The 33-year-old Wilson was traded from the Seahawks to the Broncos in exchange for a huge haul, including two first-round draft picks, two second-rounders, a fifth-rounder, quarterback Drew Lock, defensive tackle Shelby Harris and tight end Noah Fant. The nine-time Pro-Bowler, who has consistently been one of the best quarterbacks in the league since he was drafted in 2012, says that he chose to move to Denver for one reason only: \"That's to win.\"Read More\"That's what I believe in. So every day, what you're going to get from me is that mentality,\" Wilson explained at the press conference. \"You're going to get that juice. You're going to get that energy. \"You're going to get that focus and we're going to do it together. All the guys back there, we're going to do it together because that what it takes. We're here for one thing and that's to win. That's to win at the highest level, often. I'm excited about it. I'm excited about the journey, so Broncos country, let's ride.\"Wilson added that he hopes to play \"10 to 12 more years\" and win \"three to four more Super Bowls,\" planning to \"finish on top as a champion.\"Hackett address the media as Wilson looks on.Mutual decision Before Wilson's opening press conference as a Denver player, the Seahawks hierarchy released statements saying that the decision for Wilson to move on was one driven by the quarterback himself. \"While Russell made it clear he wanted this change, he made Seattle proud and we are grateful for his decade of leadership on and off the field,\" Jody Allen, chair of the Seahawks, said in a statement. \"We look forward to welcoming our new players and to everyone being fully engaged while working our hardest to win every single day. I trust our leadership to take us into the future and know we all wish Russell the very best.\"Head coach Pete Carroll echoed Allen's message. \"This has always been a challenging time of year where we have consistently maintained a competitive approach to getting better as a team,\" Carroll said. \"As Jody stated, Russ' desire in doing something different afforded the organization an opportunity to compete in multiple ways. Wilson addresses the press on March 16.\"He has always been the ultimate competitor whose leadership and consistency helped shape our culture. Our franchise has won a lot of games and we will always be grateful for the exciting moments and incredible records.\"However, Wilson said that the decision to leave Seattle was a mutual one, a decision reached between him and the team. \"I didn't initiate it; it was definitely mutual. Along the way, there's definitely been a lot of conversations. It hasn't been I initiating anything, but it is what it is. I'm excited, I'm happy to be here, that's all I know. Obviously, I'm happy about the 10 years I've had but I think that -- you know, it's, you know, we'll have to read about it later, we'll have some fun in my book one day, we'll have some good stories.\"",

Since lifting the World Cup on home soil in 2011, New Zealand's rugby team has boasted a win percentage close to 90%. Its reign as the world No. 1 ranked side goes back nine years, and it comes as no surprise that Steve Hansen's men have been hotly tipped to win a third consecutive World Cup in Japan next year. Follow @cnnsport\n\nWhen it comes to the depth of players at their disposal, not to mention the skill set and athleticism those players bring to the field, it's little surprise the All Blacks have been rugby's dominant force for the best part of the past decade.

He'd moved upstairs to have more room to enjoy his two passions: rock-n-roll and dance.Hughes was aglow in red and yellow spotlights, and the mosh pit grinded along with the singer. After about 30 minutes, the band moved to do its latest tune, a remake of Duran Duran's smash hit \"Save A Prayer.\"The bands had sung the song together in London recently. Now Eagles of Death Metal would do it solo:Don't say a prayer for me nowSave it 'til the morning afterAnd on the morning after, prayers were being said all over the world, for Paris and its people.Resilience amid griefAt least 130 people were killed in seven locations in the city. More than 350 were wounded. The coordinated attack was the deadliest in France since World War II. ISIS claimed responsibility.So much has transpired in one short week: French air strikes on ISIS targets in Syria. An international manhunt for terrorists with raids in France, Belgium, Italy, Germany and Turkey. The killing of the man considered the ringleader of the assault on Paris.And a warning from ISIS: It has its sights on New York, Rome and Washington.But for many, thoughts keep returning to Friday night, November 13. To those moments in two restaurants, two cafes, a bar, the city's main stadium and the Bataclan.

Many were 20-somethings, university students or young professionals enjoying the start of their careers.Those who survived live with two competing emotions: gratefulness and grief. Eagles of Death Metal fans have always been a tight-knit crowd -- never more so than now, bound by one awful night and determined to tell a story of love. 'We are here to kill you'Three gunmen came in through the front door. Two wore masks. They were dressed in black and armed with AK-47s and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. They said they were retaliating against France's bombing of ISIS in Syria. \"We are here to kill you,\" one  shouted. They were calm, acting with precision as they sprayed the concert hall with bullets. One would shoot while the other reloaded. Then, repeat. The gunfire seemed to last an eternity. Scores of fans rushed toward exits. Others jumped on stage and hid behind massive speakers. Many dropped to the ground, struck by bullets, dodging them or paralyzed by fear. Forty-nine-year-old Pat Moore, and his wife Maria, 50, were there with about 10 English and French fans who they'd bonded with over the music.  The Moores had witnessed terror before. A decade earlier, they'd been preparing to see another band when suicide bombers struck London's transit system, killing more than 50.JUST WATCHEDMemories of Bataclan concerts go viralReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMemories of Bataclan concerts go viral 01:23The Moores were standing toward the left front of the hall, near the stage. They saw people diving onto the ground and band members running for cover.JUST WATCHEDParis survivor describes hiding in Bataclan bathroom ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHParis survivor describes hiding in Bataclan bathroom  03:01Pat grabbed his wife's arm and pushed her toward a nearby exit. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Muyal-Leiris, 35, fell to the floor amid the hail of bullets. So did her friend Nicolas Strohl, who she'd known since they were both about 12. They lay still as the gunmen executed anyone who showed signs of life.In the balcony, Denys Plaud ran for the stairs to the third floor -- and kept running, up and up, followed by a growing crowd of fans desperate to escape the carnage. They found sanctuary in a tiny room and used a refrigerator to barricade the door.Isobel Bowdery, 22, and her boyfriend, Amaury Baudoin, 24, had gotten separated in the crowd shortly before the shooting. Isobel dove to the ground, blood and bodies all around. She held her breath, trying not to cry. She listened as a wounded couple said their goodbyes. She closed her eyes and pictured everyone she'd ever loved. Amaury was near the stage and struck by shrapnel. Pain shot through his leg and neck. He saw the silhouette of a gunman and hopped onto the stage and kept running. He searched for an exit, then ducked into a bathroom. Others joined him. Soon, more than 50 were inside.Gunfire continued to rattle the hall.  He feared for his girlfriend. Was she alive?Huddled in the room, he thought about death. Death at the age of 24. Faces of family and friendsPat and Maria Moore fled toward the exit. They turned back when they realized a friend wasn't with them. He'd been trampled in the crush to escape. He had a broken collar bone and other injuries. He got to the door just as they did.Husband and wife grabbed him. \"I'm done for,\" the friend said. He wanted to sit down. They hoisted him up and made their way down the street.Lead singer Jesse Hughes sprinted past with his girlfriend. \"Run, baby, run,\" he urged her. Upstairs, crammed in a room with at least a dozen others, Denys Plaud could do nothing but sit in the dark and listen to the gunfire -- at first far below, then alarmingly close. The shooting went on for over an hour. Shots. Silence. Then, more shots. Bullets hit the wall. He wondered if it would hold up.In the bathroom backstage, Amaury Baudoin felt a desperate optimism take over. Strangers, huddled together, tried to reassure each other. If the gunmen found them, they decided, they would overpower them.\"All the while, I was thinking of Isobel.\"Isobel was amid the carnage on the main floor. But she did not move. She did not flinch. She did not want to alert the killers that she was still alive. She was curled into a fetal position. A wounded man shielded her body. \"Don't run,\" he told her. \"Just stay.\"What do you do when death is at hand?Isobel pictured the faces of her family, her friends. And she whispered over and over: \"I love you.\" Makeshift memorials have popped up outside the Bataclan to honor those killed and wounded inside. 'I just wanted to be with her'Antoine Leiris received a message from his wife's sister. \"How are you?\" it said.He had not heard Paris was under siege. He turned on the television. He kept thinking anything was possible when he saw the Bataclan was targeted. Then, worry consumed him. He couldn't reach H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. He thought of their 17-month-old son growing up without his mother. Married and a mother to a young son, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Muyal-Leiris, was shot inside the concert hall.He spent the next 24 hours searching every hospital in Paris and its suburbs. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was nowhere to be found.Finally, Saturday evening, the medical examiner's office called; his wife's body was there. He went straight to the office. It was closed. He tried to force his way in, but couldn't. \"I felt really bad to have left her alone for two nights,\" Antoine told CNN. \"Dead or alive, that was not the point. I just wanted to be with her.\" 'Overwhelming love'The Moores made their way to a friend's apartment. Still in shock, they drank a bottle of wine and sipped hard whiskey. Four comrades had been shot but survived. They nicknamed one of them \"Two Bullets.\" \"We've had so much support,\" Maria Moore said. \"There's been an overwhelming amount of love and even laughs in the past few days.\"Laughter, even amid the tears. The friends had decided to meet up at the Paris show in honor of a woman in their network, a rock photographer, who had committed suicide last year. \"We think she was looking after us all in there, because we all made it out.\"Maria paused. \"I don't know if I believe in that stuff. But it's a comforting thought.\" Maria Moore, second from right, with friends.The terror won't prevent the group from doing what they love. They'll still dance at rock gigs. They'll still visit Paris. \"We'll go back the first chance we get.\"Denys Plaud was evacuated by police from the balcony. He was shaken up \"in a bad way\" and took shelter in a nearby courtyard where local residents offered him clothes to keep warm and a bed for the night.But like the Moores, he remains committed to his beloved music. Reflecting on his decision to move from the lower floor to the balcony because there was more room to dance, he said, \"That's probably what saved my life.\"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Muyal-Leiris died in her friend's arms at the Bataclan. Her husband Antoine was reunited with her body on Monday. He penned a Facebook post that went viral. \"On Friday evening you stole the life of an exceptional person, the love of my life, the mother of my son,\" he wrote, \"but you will not have my hatred.\" He later elaborated on why he felt it was important to write such a tribute. \"I didn't have a choice,\" he told CNN, \"if I wanted my son to grow up as a human being who is open to the world around him, like his mother, to grow up as a person who will love what she loved: literature, culture, music, cinema, pictures.\"JUST WATCHEDHusband to terrorists: 'I will not succumb to hate'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHusband to terrorists: 'I will not succumb to hate' 03:35He sat with his son. They talked about how much they miss her. They listened to music she would play, and together they cried.\"My son is only 17 months old, but he feels everything. He knows everything,\" Antoine said. \"The grief is here and we keep it as a 'treasure' -- it is a souvenir of her. We don't pretend we're not sad, that we're not devastated.  \"No, we are -- but we're still standing.\"Isobel Bowdery and Amaury Baudoin weren't sure if the other had survived.Amaury doesn't recall how much time he spent in hiding. When at last he and the others were escorted out of the hall, police told them to keep their eyes on the ceiling. But Amaury glanced around.\"My eyes swept the room, my stomach churning at the thought of finding Isobel sprawled in the center of this disaster,\" he wrote on Facebook.\"There were bodies everywhere. ... It wasn't a war scene. It was a slaughter house.\"Isobel had been taken to a police safe area. She worried about Amaury's fate. It had been hours since they last saw one another. She heard a voice crying her name. \"Isobel! ISOBEL!\" It was distant at first, but grew closer. She ran toward Amaury and leapt into his arms, draping herself around his neck.

There was a lot of positivity in such a tragic, tragic place.\" The terrorists, she was determined, would not win. \"I didn't want them to have their horrible actions determine the end of my life. I wanted the people that I loved to win -- to know that they blessed me with an incredible life. \"It was important that if I was going to die -- if the next bullet was for me -- that I left saying I love you. And in that way, it felt OK to die, because I had love in my heart.\"It is the feeling she carries with her now, in the city known as an international symbol of love.That's the best way, she said, to defeat terrorism.CNN's Anderson Cooper, Poppy Harlow, Hala Gorani, Lauren Moorhouse, Saskya Vandoorne and Florence Davey-Attlee contributed to this story.",
